Question: 
Sometimes when I run my application it gives me an error that looks like:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
        at com.example.myproject.Book.getTitle(Book.java:16)
        at com.example.myproject.Author.getBookTitles(Author.java:25)
        at com.example.myproject.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:14)

People have referred to this as a "stack trace". What is a stack trace? What can it tell me about the error that's happening in my program?


About this question - quite often I see a question come through where a novice programmer is "getting an error", and they simply paste their stack trace and some random block of code without understanding what the stack trace is or how they can use it. This question is intended as a reference for novice programmers who might need help understanding the value of a stack trace.

Question: 
If I get a NullPointerException in a call like this:
someObject.getSomething().getSomethingElse().
    getAnotherThing().getYetAnotherObject().getValue();

I get a rather useless exception text like:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
at package.SomeClass.someMethod(SomeClass.java:12)

I find it rather hard to find out wich call actually returend null, often finding myself refactoring the code to something like this:
Foo ret1 = someObject.getSomething();
Bar ret2 = ret1.getSomethingElse();
Baz ret3 = ret2.getAnotherThing();
Bam ret4 = ret3.getYetAnotherOject();
int ret5 = ret4.getValue();

and then waiting for a more descriptive NullPointerException that tells me which line to look for.
Some of you might argue that concatening getters is bad style and should be avoided anyway, but my Question is: Can I find the bug without changing the code? 
Hint: I'm using eclipse and I know what a debugger is, but I can't figuere out how to apply it to the problem.
My conclusion on the answers:<br />
Some answers told me that I should not chain getters one after another, some answers showed my how to debug my code if I disobayed that advice.
I've accepted an answer that taught me excactly when to chain getters:

If they cannot return null, chain them as long as you like. No need for checking != null, no need to worry about NullPointerExceptions (be warned that chaining still vialotes the law of demeter, but I can live with that)
If they may return null, don't ever, never ever chain them, and perform a check for null values on each one that may return null

This makes any good advice on actual debugging useless.

Question: 
I'm switching from Tomcat to Glassfish for an app server. Glassfish is so much more complicated its a little overwhelming. Anyway now I'm getting an exception:
java.lang.NullPointerException
    at org.apache.jsp.jsps.login_jsp._jspService(login_jsp.java from :67)
Where tomcat shows you the line number and gives me some information on the stderr or stdout, this just shows the error in the compliled jsp file, which is pretty much useless to me. How can I get it to show more information - at least the line in the JSP throwing the exception?

Question: 
I am trying to write the simples GUI countdown. I found in Internet some code but it is already too fancy for me. I am trying to keep it as simple as possible. So, I just want to have a window saying "You have 10 second left". The number of second should decrease every second from 10 to 0. I wrote a code. And I think I am close to the working solution. But I still missing something. Could you pleas help me to find out what is wrong? Here is my code:
import javax.swing.*;

public class Countdown {

    static JLabel label;

    // Method which defines the appearance of the window.   
    private static void showGUI() {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Simple Countdown");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        JLabel label = new JLabel("Some Text");
        frame.add(label);
        frame.pack();
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }

    // Define a new thread in which the countdown is counting down.
    static Thread counter = new Thread() {
        public void run() {
            for (int i=10; i0; i=i-1) {
                updateGUI(i,label);
                try {Thread.sleep(1000);} catch(InterruptedException e) {};
            }
        }
    };

    // A method which updates GUI (sets a new value of JLabel).
    private static void updateGUI(final int i, final JLabel label) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable(i,label) {

            public Runnable(int i, JLabel label) {
                this.i = i;
                this.label = label;
            }

            public void run() {
                label.setText("You have " + i + " seconds.");
            }

        });
    }

    // The main method (entry point).
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                showGUI();
                //counter.start();
            }
        });
        //counter.start();
    }

}

And I have several concrete question about this code:

Where should I place the counter.start();? (In my code I put it on 2 places. Which one is correct?)
Why compiler complains about the constructor for Runnable? It says that I have an invalid method declaration and I need to specify the returned type.

ADDED:
I made the suggested corrections. And then I execute the code and get:
Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.NullPointerException
at Worker.run(Worker.java:12)

In the Worker.java in the line 12 I have: label.setText("You have " + i + " seconds.");.

Question: 
I made a java application and bundled all classes in a jar file. When I run the project from eclipse, my application is running successfully. But when I try to run my .jar file, I am not getting the icons used by my application. In the code I get my icons from images directory present in project folder. How can I present these image files to the end user when using a jar?
I am loading the image like so:
 final public ImageIcon iReport=new ImageIcon("images/Report.png");

I have also tried 
final public ImageIcon iquit=new ImageIcon(getClass().getResource("images/quit.png"));

and 
final public ImageIcon iquit=new ImageIcon(getClass().getResource("/images/quit.png"));

But this results in an error:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException

at eci.pdsw2012.shoeople.logic.PersonCatalog.loadFile(PersonCatalog.java:31)
Question: 
First of all I want to thank you for the help you can give me,
I'm developing an JSF web application,
with the current 2.1.7 JSF version.
Actually, i have a login page, associated with a session bean,
which calls to a logic class "PersonCatalog",
which is responsible for reading a text file .txt with the information of the persons, like a database but with files.
The problem is to access the file,
ever i get an NullException because the program doesn't finds the file.
I'm not sure about the path i choose, here is the directory herarchy:
Application
 |-- build
 |-- src
       |--eci
           |--pdsw2012
               |--shoeople
                   |--beans
                       |--loginBean and others ...
                   |--logic
                       |--PersonCatalog and others...
                   |--persistence
                       |--files
                           |--persons.txt
 |-- WebContent
       |--WEB-INF
       |--META-INF
       |--a lot of xhtml pages ...

I'm using in PersonCatalog for read the person.txt file the follow code:
File readFile = new File(new String("src/eci/pdsw2012/shoeople/persistence/files/persons.txt"));

But i get:
java.lang.NullPointerException
at eci.pdsw2012.shoeople.logic.PersonCatalog.loadFile(PersonCatalog.java:31)

I have used the ExternalContext().getRealPath(), but it only shows inside Web-content folder.
I'm using eclipse, and the default route is the installation folder of Eclipse, the is so strange:
String ruta = System.getProperty("user.dir");
System.out.println("DirAbs: " + ruta.getAbsolutePath());

and prints
 C:/Eclipse/

Thank you in advance for your help,
greetings

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
    at PrimeNumberFinder.main(PrimeNumberFinder.java:27)
Question: 
I am attempting to create a program that will generate all of the prime numbers between two given integers(A &amp; B) for T cases. I am implementing the Prime Sieve of Eratosthenes. My code is below. I have read that NullPointerException for the line mentioned in code would be a result of me not initialising the Boolean array. However, I thought I had done this here: 
Boolean[] N = new Boolean[B+1];

Therefore, I am confused as to why this Exception is being thrown. I am aware of no other possible cause. What is wrong with my code?
My error and input:
1 1 5
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException

My Code:
class PrimeNumberFinder {

    public static void main(String[] args){

        int T = sc.nextInt();

        //complete for every case
        for(int i = 1; i=T; i++){
            //read the boundaries to find primes between
            int A = sc.nextInt();
            int B = sc.nextInt();
            //create boolean array to store primes, according with the Sieve
            Boolean[] N = new Boolean[B+1];

Question: 
I use rJava to integrate Java and R in my project.
I need to load GWmodel R package in my application and calculate the distance matrix from Java.
This is my function to load GWmodel and calculating distance matrix :
Rengine engine = new Rengine(new String[] { "--no-save" }, false, null);
engine.eval("library(GWmodel)");
engine.eval("data(LondonHP)");
engine.eval("DM - gw.dist(dp.locat=coordinates(londonhp))");
double[][] matrix = engine.eval("DM").asMatrix();

But the code result an error :
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
    at rjavaexm.RJavaExm.main(RJavaExm.java:30)

So, I want to know, is it possible to load R package and data using rJava from Java like code above?
Or are there any appropriate ways to do that?

Question: 
I got these two forms in Java which are linked to two tables in MySQL. I've done the connection and the database saves the data entered through the front-end. But the two forms ar linked. It's like when one button is clicked in one form, it sends all the data to the other form in the form of a table. Here's the coding I did for this:
int dress1=100;
double price1=Double.parseDouble(Price1.getText());
DefaultTableModel CurrentPurchases= new DefaultTableModel();
int rows=CurrentPurchases.getRowCount();
if (rows0){
    for (int i = 0; i  rows; i++) {
    CurrentPurchases.removeRow(0); }
}
try{
    Connection connection=getConnection();
    stmt=connection.createStatement();
    String Buy1Query1="Update Products set Quantity=Quantity-1 where Product_no=1;";
    String Buy1Query2="Insert into Buy values('"+Pname1.getText()+"',"+price1+");";
    stmt.executeUpdate(Buy1Query1);
    stmt.executeUpdate(Buy1Query2);
    dress1--;
    if(dress1==0){
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Sorry, This Item is Out of Stock!");
    }
    new ShoppingCart().setVisible(true);
    String Pname="";
    double Price;
    PreparedStatement buyquery=connection.prepareStatement("Select * from Buy;");
    rs=buyquery.executeQuery();
    Pname=rs.getString("ProductName");
    Price=rs.getDouble("Price");
    CurrentPurchases.addRow(new Object[]{Pname,Price});

}
catch(SQLException ex){
    ex.printStackTrace();
    ex.getErrorCode();
}
finally{}

When I run the file the following errors appear:

when I clicked on this error:
 at Fashion_Footwear.Buy1ActionPerformed(Fashion_Footwear.java:370)

It gave me this code as error:
    Pname=rs.getString("ProductName");

I'm a newbie to all this, and I'd really appreciate it if someone helps me as soon as possible. Thank you in advance! 
Table Buy:
create table buy(ProductName varchar(100),Price decimal(7,2));

Operation not allowed after ResultSet closed

Question: 
I have a "Manager" class and also one frame which is"Report"  .In the frame I have three radio buttons which their texts are "Years before 1970","between 1970 and 2000","years after 2000" and if one of them is selected , in the text field below these radio buttons I will show the number of rows that have this situation which are in my SQL table.also in my SQL table I have created a table that has name, family, fatherName,motherName,dateOfBirth,placeOfBirth,Also the first column is ID which is created automatically .the text in dateOfBirth column is like"December 5, 2009" and I need just its year !!! but when i run this code these stack trace will be shown in the console,why?? please help me.

Question: 
Is there a limit to the number of joins permitted in a JPA/Hibernate query?
Since Hibernate <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/118.html#A23" rel="nofollow">doesn't automatically join, I have to explicitly specify the joins in my JPA/Hibernate query. For example, person has an address, an address has a state. The following query retrieves person(s) with address and state fully loaded:
select p, a, s from person p left join p.address a left join a.state s where ...

As I keep adding joins, I eventually (after 12-13 left joins) reach a limit where Hibernate generates invalid SQL:
Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: Column 'something69_2_' not found.

I do have Hibernate's dialect set to my database implementation, MySQL:
property name="hibernate.dialect"org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLInnoDBDialect/property

Is there an limit to the number joins Hibernate can handle in a single query?
Edit 1: The following is in the log file:
could not read column value from result set: something69_2_; Column 'something69_2_' not found.

However, something69_2_ doesn't appear in the SQL query. It's like Hibernate generated a SQL query and is expecting something69_2_ to be in the results, which is not.
Edit 2: Similar problem documented as an <a href="http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-3035" rel="nofollow">unfixed Hibernate bug HHH-3035
Edit 3: This is a documented <a href="http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-3636" rel="nofollow">Hibernate bug HHH-3636, which has been fixed but is not part of any release yet.
Edit 4: I built hibernate-core 3.3.2-SNAPSHOT which includes bug fix HHH-3636 and it did not address this problem.
Edit 5: The bug behavior seems to be triggered by multiple LEFT JOIN FETCH on ManyToMany or OneToMany relationships. One will work, two or three results in the bug.

Edit 7: The reason for all these joins is to avoid Hibernate doing n+1 queries, see <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/118.html#A23" rel="nofollow">Hibernate FAQ on How can I avoid n+1 SQL SELECT queries when running a Hibernate query?

java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found for jdbc:sqlserver://DBALIASSTAGING:1433
  at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(DriverManager.java:689)
Question: 
I have my Selenium tests written in java (Eclipse). I connect to SQL Server and verify some results in database, using JDBC SQLServerDriver; The tests run perfectly in Eclipse : (Class.forName(com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver).newInstance();).  
While I need to execute them via command line I run the following line:
mvn clean install -Dtest=Test1 test
The test gets executed only until it has to connect SQL Server to verify the data. I get error message that says:

  java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found for jdbc:sqlserver://DBALIASSTAGING:1433
  at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(DriverManager.java:689)

I point to JDK 1.8 in Eclipse and in my JAVA_HOME. I have my sqljdbc4.jar pointed at in Eclipse and in CLASSPATH (C:\Microsoft JDBC Driver 4.0\sqljdbc_4.0\enu\sqljdbc4.jar).
Anything else I am missing? The weird thing is the Test1 runs very well- connects and searches database within Eclipse only. But fails to connect SQL Server via command line, when I run mvn clean install -Dtest=Test1 test. The run well, but chokes when need to connect to SQL Server (11).
I have read all the posts on sqljdbc4.jar and set up the CLASSPATH variable properly and couldn't find anything wrong in my configuration.  
Please give me a clue or a hint, I am totally lost, what am I doing wrong?

Question: 
I´m a little bit frustrated with my Java environment that didn´t allow me to call the method OraclePreparedStatement#setPlsqlIndexTable ... but i think i should write the code before...
String plSqlBody = "some pl/sql procedure call"
/*
 * The PL/SQL procedure parameter is here of type
 * TYPE t_date_table IS TABLE OF DATE INDEX BY PLS_INTEGER;
 */
OracleCallableStatement ocs = (OracleCallableStatement)
        conn.prepareCall(plSqlBody);
java.util.Date[] date = new java.util.Date[10];
// Initialise the array... and then...
ocs.setPlsqlIndexTable(index, date, 20, 20, OracleTypes.DATE, 20);

And here i get my exception:
java.sql.SQLException: Ungültiger PL/SQL-Indextabellen-Elementtyp
at oracle.jdbc.driver.SQLStateMapping.newSQLException(SQLStateMapping.java:70)

I didn´t find a solution for the problem. I changed the Java type from java.util.Date to java.sql.Date / oracle.sql.DATE and OracleTypes.DATE to OracleTypes.TIME / OracleTypes.TIMESTAMP, but nothing solved the problem. I find somewhere the hint, that these types are not allowed here, but i can´t believe it. Do you know the right way here?

People have referred to this as a "stack trace". What is a stack trace? What can it tell me about the error that's happening in my program?


About this question - quite often I see a question come through where a novice programmer is "getting an error", and they simply paste their stack trace and some random block of code without understanding what the stack trace is or how they can use it. This question is intended as a reference for novice programmers who might need help understanding the value of a stack trace.

Question: 
I'm pretty new to java and I've got a problem that I couldn't solve by myself. I googled the exception but problem is too specific as far as I can understand so I find myself here. Here is my problem.
I have a class called Student which has fallowing data members and their get/set methods:
private String studentNumber;
private String firstName;
private String lastName;
private int age;
private String gender;
private String country;

and I created an array of instances as fallowing:
Student studentList[] = new Student(10);

I got a database(a text file) as fallowing
081935 Cengiz rrrrr Male 21 Turkey
082935 Ayşe aaaaa Female 22 England
083935 Onur bbbbb Male 23 Germany
084935 Fatma ccccc Female 24 Cyprus
085935 Ali dddd Male 21 China
086935 Zehra eeee Female 22 Denmark
087935 Murat ffff Male 25 France
088935 Selin ggggg Female 26 Japan
086935 Cengiz hhhh Male 20 Korea
080935 Damla qqqqqq Female 19 Iran

What I'm trying to do is getting all these informations to my class instances and I try to achieve this is fallowing:
import java.io.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class StudentTracker  {

    private static int counter = 0;
    private static Student studentList[];

    public static void readFromFile() throws FileNotFoundException {
        File file = new File("Database.txt");
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new FileReader(file));
        try {
              while (scanner.hasNextLine()){
                processLine(scanner.nextLine());
              }
        } finally {
            scanner.close();
        }
    }


    public static void processLine(String line) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(line);
        scanner.useDelimiter(" ");
        if (scanner.hasNext()) {
          studentList[counter].setStudentNumber(scanner.next());
          studentList[counter].setFirstName(scanner.next());
          studentList[counter].setLastName(scanner.next());
          studentList[counter].setGender(scanner.next());
          studentList[counter].setAge(Integer.parseInt(scanner.next()));
          studentList[counter].setCountry(scanner.next());      
          counter++;
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("Empty or invalid line. Unable to process.");
        }
      }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {

        studentList = new Student[10];
        readFromFile();
        for(int i = 0; i  10; i++) {
            System.out.printf(studentList[i].getStudentNumber(), " ",
                              studentList[i].getFirstName());

        }

    }

}

but it gives fallowing error:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
    at StudentTracker.processLine(StudentTracker.java:28)
    at StudentTracker.readFromFile(StudentTracker.java:16)
    at StudentTracker.main(StudentTracker.java:68)

by the way couldn't find a function like C-scanf which gets the input until first white space so I find another way to parse the strings from line with
readFromFile() and processLine functions but I'm not sure if they're workig as intended.
Thank you in advance

Question: 
I have a problem with with 
javax.crypto.Cipher

When I write this lines of code
    Cipher cipher;
    byte[] bytes = null;

    try
    {
        cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, generateAESKey128b(key));

    }
    catch (BadPaddingException e)
    {

The console give me this error

The first 2 lines of code are correct but when I pass the attribute "text", of type byte[], to the doFinal function, it give me the error.
Can someone tell me why?
SOLVED:
Okay, problem solved
byte[] encrypted = UniversalBase64Encoder.decode(input);
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, generateAESKey128b(key));
byte[] originalBytes = cipher.doFinal(encrypted);

This is the right code that I wrote

at Hmwkal.main(Hmwkal.java:7)
Question: 
I'm having trouble with this homework problem, it compiles correctly, but I'm getting an exception that I can't figure out. Here's what's in my main method
MyLinkedListH1 list = new MyLinkedListH1();

  list.addLast(5);
   list.addLast(6);
   list.addLast(7);

   list.addFirst(1);
  list.addFirst(2);
  list.addFirst(3);

 list.traverse();

  list.print();

And the addLast method (which worked when within the main method I performed addFirst before doing a single addLast, but I don't see how that would make a difference).
public void addLast(int d)
{
    Node newNode = new Node();
    newNode.x = d;
    newNode.link = null;

    Node p = first;
    if(first == null)
    {
        first = newNode;
    }
    while (p.link != null)            
  {  
        p = p.link;  
  }
        p.link = newNode;
  }

And the exception:
 Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
at MyLinkedListH1$Node.access$200(Hmwkal.java:23)
at MyLinkedListH1.addLast(Hmwkal.java:50)
at Hmwkal.main(Hmwkal.java:7)

So it seems it's having a problem with the pointer going null. Sorry if it's something obvious, I've only been programming for a few months and linked lists aren't a strong suit of mine.
If necessary, here's the full code:
class Hmwkal
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
       MyLinkedListH1 list = new MyLinkedListH1();

   list.addLast(5);
  list.addLast(6);
  list.addLast(7);

  list.addFirst(1);
  list.addFirst(2);
  list.addFirst(3);

  list.traverse();

  list.print(); 
   }
}

class MyLinkedListH1  
{
    private class Node 
{
      private Node link;
      private int x;
}

   private Node first = null;  

   public void addFirst(int d)
   {
       Node newNode = new Node(); 
       newNode.x = d;            
       newNode.link = first;     
       first = newNode;          
   }

public void addLast(int d)
{
    Node newNode = new Node();
    newNode.x = d;
    newNode.link = null;

    Node p = first;
    if(first == null)
    {
        first = newNode;
    }
    while (p.link != null)            
      {  
        p = p.link;  
      }
        p.link = newNode;
      }
         public void print()
         {
            Node listNode = first;
            while (listNode != null)
         {
            System.out.println(listNode.x);
            listNode = listNode.link;
         }
      }

   public void traverse() //This AND the print might be redundant
   {
       Node p = first;
       while (p != null)
       {
       System.out.println(p.x);
       p = p.link;
       }
    }
}

Thanks so much for any help ^_^

Question: 
There are some similar questions, I checked them but could not find a solution to my problem. I am trying very basic spring application but getting error.
here is my appcontext.xml
context:annotation-config/context:annotation-config

and my component
@Component("springService")
public class SpringServiceImpl implements SpringService{
    @Override
    public void giveService() {
        System.err.println("service given");
    }
}

and my wired variable
public class Printer {
    @Autowired
    private SpringService springService;

    public void print(){
        springService.giveService();
    }
}

and inside main method
ApplicationContext ac = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationcontext.xml");
Printer printer = new Printer();
printer.print();

and the error is 
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
    at com.spring.springlegacy.Printer.print(Printer.java:10)
    at com.spring.springlegacy.Main.main(Main.java:13)

What is missing here ?
PS: Since I am not using new keyword for spring managed objects, I believe this question is different from others.

Question: 
I got these two forms in Java which are linked to two tables in MySQL. I've done the connection and the database saves the data entered through the front-end. But the two forms ar linked. It's like when one button is clicked in one form, it sends all the data to the other form in the form of a table. Here's the coding I did for this:
int dress1=100;
double price1=Double.parseDouble(Price1.getText());
DefaultTableModel CurrentPurchases= new DefaultTableModel();
int rows=CurrentPurchases.getRowCount();
if (rows0){
    for (int i = 0; i  rows; i++) {
    CurrentPurchases.removeRow(0); }
}
try{
    Connection connection=getConnection();
    stmt=connection.createStatement();
    String Buy1Query1="Update Products set Quantity=Quantity-1 where Product_no=1;";
    String Buy1Query2="Insert into Buy values('"+Pname1.getText()+"',"+price1+");";
    stmt.executeUpdate(Buy1Query1);
    stmt.executeUpdate(Buy1Query2);
    dress1--;
    if(dress1==0){
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Sorry, This Item is Out of Stock!");
    }
    new ShoppingCart().setVisible(true);
    String Pname="";
    double Price;
    PreparedStatement buyquery=connection.prepareStatement("Select * from Buy;");
    rs=buyquery.executeQuery();
    Pname=rs.getString("ProductName");
    Price=rs.getDouble("Price");
    CurrentPurchases.addRow(new Object[]{Pname,Price});

}
catch(SQLException ex){
    ex.printStackTrace();
    ex.getErrorCode();
}
finally{}

When I run the file the following errors appear:
java.sql.SQLException

when I clicked on this error:
 at Fashion_Footwear.Buy1ActionPerformed(Fashion_Footwear.java:370)

It gave me this code as error:
    Pname=rs.getString("ProductName");

I'm a newbie to all this, and I'd really appreciate it if someone helps me as soon as possible. Thank you in advance! 
Table Buy:
create table buy(ProductName varchar(100),Price decimal(7,2));

Question: 
I am new here and need your help ...
I'm just a beginner so bear with me for any stupidity in the code.
I have made a project on railway management system and want to insert values from text fields and java table to MySQL database.
How can I get rid of this error? "column index out of range,3>1 "
Here's the code I wrote:
      try{

  Class.forName("java.sql.Driver");
  con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/railway","root","ridhi");
  st =con.createStatement();

  String sourcee =(String) cb1.getSelectedItem();
  String desti =(String) cb2.getSelectedItem();
  String art =(String) cb3.getSelectedItem();
  String tic= tick.getText();
  String rdate=frm.getText();
  String rdatde=to.getText();
  String rdagte=bp.getText();
  String rdagtge=ru.getText();
  String ddate=date.getText();
  String pnr=l1.getText();

  String q="INSERT INTO pnr values("+l1.getText()+","+cb1.getSelectedItem()+","+"'"+cb2.getSelectedItem()+"'"+","+"'"+frm.getText()+"'"+","+"'"+to.getText()+"'"+","+"'"+date.getText()+"'"+","+"'"+cb3.getSelectedItem()+"'"+","+"'"+ru.getText()+"'"+","+"'"+bp.getText()+"'"+","+tick.getText()+");";

  st.executeUpdate(q);
  while(rs.next()){
     model.getRow(new Object[]{
        rs.getInt(11),rs.getString(12),rs.getInt(13), rs.getString(14),
        rs.getString(15), rs.getString(16) 
               }  );   }
         }

  catch(Exception e){
    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,e.getMessage());

        }

Question: 
I started to working on SQLite database for my table. And I'm getting this error when I'm trying to save informations to database with text lanes. I'm working with NetBeans.
private void Cmd_saveActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {                                           
   try{
      String sql = "Insert into KYaziciProg (Yapılan İşlem ,Müşteri Adı ,Ürünün Cinsi ,Ürünün Miktarı ,Ürünün Fiyatı ,Ürünün Tutarı ,İşlem Tarihi ,Ödeme Vadesi ,Yapılan Ödeme ,Kalan Bakiye) values (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)";

      pst=conn.prepareStatement(sql);
      pst.setString(2, jTextField2.getText());
      pst.setString(3, jTextField1.getText());
      pst.setString(4, jTextField3.getText());
      pst.setString(5, jTextField4.getText());
      pst.setString(6, jTextField5.getText());
      pst.setString(7, jTextField6.getText());
      pst.setString(8, jTextField7.getText());
      pst.setString(9, jTextField8.getText());
      pst.setString(10, jTextField9.getText());
      pst.setString(11, jTextField10.getText());

      pst.execute();

      JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Kaydedildi!");

   }   
   catch(Exception e)
   {     
      JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, e);   
   }  
   Update_table();

Question: 
Before you ask why there is an object using a setter and getter to add and retrieve data in the database , our instructor told us to this, we should learn JDBC by its root, now I am wondering how come my query won't work? it gives me an index out of range specifically on line 63 and 62
