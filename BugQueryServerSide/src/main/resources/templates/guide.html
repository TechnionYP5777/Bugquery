	<h1>BugQuery Essentials</h1>
	<p>This guide provides the essential information you can use to
		debug your code with BugQuery. It describes in detail the services
		BugQuery offers online and as a plug-in for Eclipse.</p>
	<h2>Eclipse Plug-in</h2>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>BugQuery's Eclipse plug-in collects your program's stack trace,
		and helps you debug by automatically finding a relevant solution
		online, using BugQuery's index.</p>
	<p>This section will help you install the plug-in, and teach you
		how to use it.</p>
	<h3>Set Up</h3>
	<p>
		To use this plug-in you must have Eclipse installed on your machine.
		The plug-in is supported in Eclipse Neon, which you can download from
		the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse Foundation
			website</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		To download the latest version of the BugQuery plug-in itself, please
		visit <a href="https://github.com/TechnionYP5777/Bugquery">BugQuery's
			GitHub repository</a>. Locate and download
		<code>BugQuery.jar</code>
		, then move it to the folder named
		<code>dropins</code>
		in your Eclipse installation directory. If Eclipse is open, you'll
		need to restart the workspace for changes to take effect.
	</p>
	<h3>Quickly Solve Bugs</h3>
	<p>
		First, locate BugQuery's toolbar in the Eclipse toolbar. Click the
		arrow next to the main icon (<img src="./img/guide/bugquery_main.gif"></img>)
		to open the drop-down menu, which lists several stack trace extraction
		methods supported by the plug-in.
	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>To debug your program with BugQuery, select the method you
		prefer from the drop-down menu, or click the matching button in the
		toolbar. The plug-in will then use that method to retrive the stack
		trace (which includes the details of your execution), and search our
		database for a solution. The results will be presented in your default
		browser.</p>
	<p>With the BugQuery plug-in installed, you can choose from this
		selection of stack extraction methods:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>
				<b>Extract the trace from console output.</b> After an unsuccessful
				execution in Eclipse, the BugQuery plug-in can automatically isolate
				your program's stack trace from the console output. Extract the
				trace using this method by selecting
				<code>Trace from Console</code>
				from the drop-down menu, or by using the keyboard shortcut
				<code>ctrl+6</code>
				(or
				<code>&#8984;+6</code>
				in macOS). You can also click on the command's icon (<img
					src="./img/guide/bugquery_console.gif"></img>) in the toolbar.
			</p></li>
		<li><p>
				<b>Input the trace yourself.</b> If other methods fail, you can
				always initiate a BugQuery search with your own input. Add your
				query (your stack trace) to the system clipboard using your default
				copy or cut, and select
				<code>Trace from Clipboard</code>
				(<img src="./img/guide/bugquery_clipboard.gif"></img>) from the
				BugQuery toolbar. Alternatively, pick
				<code>Trace from User Dialog</code>
				(<img src="./img/guide/bugquery_dialog.gif"></img>) , and insert
				your query in the window that opens up. Click OK and you are set.
				You don't have to worry about formatting or adding unnecessary
				information - the plug-in faithfully extracts the important parts of
				your input.
			</p></li>
	</ul>
