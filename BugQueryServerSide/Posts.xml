  <row Id="12" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="2" CreationDate="2016-01-12T19:13:00.710" Score="10" Body="&lt;p&gt;There is very little information about safety available, as home 3D printers are relatively new. However, plastics such as ABS have a long history in making plastic products, and a study found that at traditional manufacturing methods (such as injection molding and hot wire cutting) &lt;a href=&quot;http://annhyg.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/3/399&quot;&gt;do not release dangerous levels of carcinogens and/or respiratory sensitizers in to the air&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, 3D printers are not among the processes covered in the study. In home 3D printing circles, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231013005086&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; that looks at ultrafine particle (UFP) emissions, is often cited. It finds that printing ABS releases relatively high levels of UFP's and PLA releases significantly fewer (but still quite a large amount). However, it is unclear whether/how dangerous these UFP's are in the amounts emitted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is often suggested that PLA, partly because of the reduced UFP emissions is safer to print than ABS, partly because of its &quot;natural&quot; origins as it can be derived from materials such as cornstarch. I would caution against this line of reasoning since &quot;natural&quot; materials can still be poisonous (snake venom is natural, after all) and the cornstarch is heavily processed so it hardly resembles its original form. The lower UFP emissions may suggest it is safer, but the study is only quantitative, not qualitative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, PLA does probably pose less of a risk (despite my earlier argumentation against &quot;natural&quot; materials, PLA does play quite nicely with the human body), but I contend the risk with ABS is not too large anyways, given that it has been safely used in factories for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire86/art017.html&quot;&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; is often miscited, supposedly saying that 3D printing ABS releases hydrogen cyanide. The study only looks at the thermal decomposition of ABS, which happens at significantly higher temperatures than are reached during printing (but a significantly malfunctioning printer might cause toxic gasses to be released, but I contend that at that point you should worry about your printer being on fire, rather than temporary exposure to some toxins).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are no printers out there that are fundamentally safer than others. However, some printers have an enclosure (containing the fumes) and some even have a carbon filter and a fan for fume extraction. If you would like to err on the side of caution, this might be a good choice (but again, it is not clear if a carbon filter is totally effective).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, as printers are generally quite noisy it tends to be preferrable to keep your printer in a separate room from where you usually work. In this case, fume exposure (during the few minutes that you go to check on your print) is minimal, and the potential advantages of a &quot;safer&quot; printers or using &quot;safer&quot; materials diminish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Incidental exposure as a hobbyist is probably not a big deal; workers in factories are exposed to the fumes of melted plastic their entire lives and they don't seem to be dropping dead. On the other hand, if you are going to be printing structurally then it is probably preferable to move your printer to a separate room, if not because of health and safety because of the noise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastEditorUserId="26" LastEditDate="2016-01-12T19:21:43.353" LastActivityDate="2016-01-12T19:21:43.353" CommentCount="2" />

Retraction is a process in which the extruder reverses its movement to pull filament back up the hotend, preventing it from dripping at the tip, and forming a string. Most slicers will allow specifying a numeric value in millimeters of filament to be retracted. Remember that printers with Bowden tubes between nozzle/hotend and extruder motor will require increased retraction and priming (extrusion when starting to print after a retract-and-move). Note that too much retraction can cause other problems, such as insufficient plastic in the hotend chamber at the start of the next printing move, which can cause gaps and other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastActivityDate="2016-01-12T20:21:03.017" CommentCount="0" />

Naturally beige in color. Can be filled and sanded. Higher temperature. Easy to recycle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PLA: Not as strong as ABS but more rigid. Naturally transparent. More difficult to fill and sand. Can sag in hot temperatures. Sourced from organic matter so it can be broken down in commercial compost facilities.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part Accuracy:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ABS: Part warping is a significant issue. Sharp corners will often be rounded.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PLA: Less heat required contributes to less warping. Becomes more liquid at common extruder temperatures so finer details can be printed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Safety and Handling:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ABS: Strong burning/melting plastic smell is present when printing ABS.

ABS will absorb moisture causing popping when the moisture enters the hot end. This leads to discontinuities in the print job.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PLA: Doesn't smell as strongly when printing due to its organic nature.

However, the fundamental reason for the &quot;warping&quot; is incorrect and inconsistent temperature across the material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is too much fluctuation in the temperature across the object in this heated state can result in warping. The reason you see this mostly on the build plate is because the temperature of the first few layers of molten plastic vary much more against the build plate than against higher layers. Note that you can see additional warping mid-print using ABS and this can be a result of a draft or sudden drop in ambient temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to help solve your problem, here are some suggestions (sorry if there are duplicates):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Completely &lt;a href=&quot;http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/1292/should-i-enclose-my-3d-printer&quot;&gt;enclose/seal your machine's build area&lt;/a&gt; to reduce (or eliminate if possible) draft and prevent the natural heat of the machine from escaping.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Increase the temperature on your build plate. I almost exclusively use ABS on my printer and I keep my HBP at about 112C. However, I live in the NW of the US, so my climate is naturally cooler than say Florida.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, &lt;a href=&quot;http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/1251/how-to-choose-an-extrusion-temperature&quot;&gt;try decreasing the nozzle temperature&lt;/a&gt; to a lower point within the ABS melting range.

When printing with wet filament, you'll sometimes hear it popping and see steam coming out of the extruder (it's usually only this extreme with nylon).  With most other filaments, when they're wet, the extruded filament will have small bubbles in it and the surface finish of the parts will be rougher, with breaks in the layer lines.  It can also lead to more oozing and stringing.  Air print a few centimeters of filament and look at it closely to see if there's any bubbles, if not, it's probably dry enough.  Whether the filament absorbs enough water to be noticeable in a few hours, in a day, or in a week depends a lot on the filament (and I assume the humidity too).  I'm mostly noticed problems with nylon, ABS, and NinjaFlex, less with PLA and PETG (though I avoid leaving any filament out for more than a day).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're not seeing any difference between, then I wouldn't worry about it.

An acetone &quot;explosion&quot; is even more unlikely, since you need a ratio of 2.5%-12.8% acetone vapor to air for that: too much acetone (as would be the case inside of your smoothing vessel) and nothing happens, too little (as would be the case inside of a badly ventilated room) and nothing happens either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that even if you were working in a completely non-ventilated, ridiculously small 1m^3 room you'd still need to evaporate over half a liter of (liquid) acetone to reach that bare minimum 2.5%. In any case, well before you got into the &quot;danger zone&quot; the air would become unbreathable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, then what should you be mindful of when using acetone?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can give you a headache.

However, limited skin contact isn't a big deal: acetone is an ingredient in some nail polish removers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetone is heavier than air, so if you use a sufficiently high container fewer fumes will escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If somehow a fire does start, it will likely be limited to your container.

Acetone isn't suspected to be carcinogenic, though it isn't something you should be careless around either. The risk of starting a fire is small.

There are many ways you can 3D print a part, even on the same machine, that can yield different results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips to help uphold strength requirements:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Identify where your stresses are and avoid allowing the natural &quot;grain&quot; of the print (ie each layer) to coincide with the stresses of the part.

I set my part up to ensure that the circular profile of the hinge on each layer, instead of having the machine &quot;bridge&quot; the circular profile.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make your part more solid by increasing the infill. Note that somewhere around 35% won't really provide much more strength than say 50% with a standard infill pattern (ie hexagonal, diamond, catfill). However, I would imagine that if a spherical infill pattern was ever designed, that would be the strongest.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An easy way to beef up small areas of a part is to increase your shell variable (how many profile layers for each layer). Again, referencing my hinge design, I made sure that my hinges were completely printed using shell instead of shell/infill.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don't be afraid to do some post-processing such as adding epoxy(ies) in high-stress areas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it's not an expensive part to print, I would suggest playing with some of these ideas yourself and conduct controlled tests to see what setups work best for your application(s).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2016-01-13T05:01:54.163" CommentCount="0" />

Depending on the motors you're driving and the size of the load you could actually see a decrease in quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although microstepping increases theoretical resolution it does not necessarily increase accuracy. The reason is that microstepping significantly limits the incremental torque of the motor. This means that you may ask for a step but not get one because the torque of the step won't be enough to actually turn the shaft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example: a motor running in full steps will have 100% of its rated holding torque. Moving to 16 microsteps/full steps drops this to ~10%, 128 drops it to ~1%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The practical effect of this is that in high torque situations (such as printing at fast speeds) the motor may end up skipping some of the steps. In this way the increase in resolution can actually lead to a decrease in accuracy (smaller steps but they may not actually be taken).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A relevant calculation to do would be to work out what the different number of microsteps to full steps works out to in terms of horizontal, vertical, or whatever movement the motor drives. You can do this by measuring how far the stepper moves said surface in one revolution provided you know the number of steps it takes per revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With no microstepping: 1 turn/inch * 200 steps/turn = 200 steps/inch or .005 inch/step (127 micron resolution)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With 16x microstepping: 16 * 200 steps/inch or .0003 inch / step (8 micron resolution)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this example 128x microstepping would be absolutely foolish.

Since the UFPs from 3D printing are still an unknown, the only real answer from a safety perspective is to treat them as dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;This is not legal, safety, or professional advice!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not qualified to give an opinion on what should be done but I will share what I would do:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venting&lt;/strong&gt; - Active airflow pushing the envelope of air around the print into a large, unpopulated body of air.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enclosure + Venting&lt;/strong&gt; - By fully enclosing your printer, it will probably keep the UFPs mostly within the enclosure. You could combine that with either continuous venting or as some have suggested purge venting before opening the enclosure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enclosure + Filtering&lt;/strong&gt; - A filter can be applied both to the vent to reduce the output of UFPs (e.g. if you have no access to a safe body of air) and as a recirculating system that removes the UFPs from the body of air within the enclosure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.silverstonetek.com/techtalk_cont.php?area=en&amp;amp;tid=wh_positive&quot;&gt;positive vs negative pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; related to venting and filtering: if you produce positive pressure within the enclosure, you are going to be blowing all the UFPs out into your environment anyway. Negative pressure vented to a safe body of air or neutral pressure with good seals and recirculated filtering may avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note on filters&lt;/strong&gt;: Activated carbon filters will not remove UFPs. HEPA filters may remove 3D printing UFPs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Which Printer?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As long as the uncertainty exists, I predict that as the market matures, filtering and enclosures will become more standard.

Bubbles in the filament, or sometimes a mismatch between the filament ideal temperature and the head temperature could create results like this, but it probably wouldn't vary so much between the layers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next I'd look at the print head.

Be especially mindful of the wires from your power supply to the board, as getting those the wrong way around will definitely cause damage. Heated beds and extruders are not polarity sensitive, and can go in either way. Fans are polarized, but will probably survive if you get them backwards - they just won't run. Stepper motors don't care about polarity, flipping the connector around just makes them run backwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take special care with endstops. The endstop connectors have 3 pins (VCC, 5V and signal), endstops with 2 pins are usually connect to GND and signal. Putting a 2-pin endstop across 5V and GND will destroy the 5V regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common cause of damage is wires not being clamped in their respective terminals properly. The offending wire will arc, melting and destroying the connector. Tighten down screw terminals properly, use proper crimps if you have them.

The principle is the same as masking tape, but Kapton tape has a smooth surface and is more durable than masking tape. The down side is Kapton tape is far more expensive, and applying it correctly is a LOT more work, since you have to use water and you have to keep bubbles from getting underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put some ABS scraps into a bottle of Acetone, and allow the acetone to break down the ABS til you have a slurry. Spread this slurry as evenly as possible across the build plate, and allow the acetone to evaporate away. This leaves a thin film of ABS on the plate, and will release much better than if you print directly onto the build plate. I recommend using clear ABS if you can, since some of it will stick to your print and clear will be the least visible. You'll need to re-apply it regularly, since it will come off with your print where it touches the build plate. &lt;strong&gt;WARNING&lt;/strong&gt;: Use proper ventilation and avoid contact with acetone.

Jerk speed is the speed that the printer will immediately jump to before taking acceleration into account. With a jerk of 20mm/s, the printer will make an immediate jump from 0 to 20 mm/s, and thereafter speed up to the desired speed by following the acceleration profile.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, it might be smart to then set the actual speed, jerk and acceleration approximately 20% below the the maximum found as a safeguard when printing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, bear in mind that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.no/search?q=stepper%20motor%20strength%20curve%20NEMA%2017&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;biw=1920&amp;amp;bih=985&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi74aLL46fKAhVIdCwKHdJbDa4QsAQIGg&amp;amp;dpr=1#imgrc=NbUjFTxiWehyKM%3A&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the strength of stepper motors lowers for higher speeds&lt;/a&gt;, so that the nozzle will not hold its path very well if obstructed.

I've also heard of people regulating temperature with a fan, in order to prevent partially melted bits of filament clogging up the inside of the nozzle, but I don't know if that's effective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the problem could even be as mundane as a support issue. I once set up a spool of filament, only to have a jam when the support for the spool failed, leaving the line of filament tugging at the nozzle and clogging it. Taking steps to prevent this from happening can be simply and effective.

By using this advice you agree to hold me harmless and not sue me as a result of using these instructions/advice. Remember that I am not a professional chemist or a lawyer (this isn't professional or legal advice)!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to research safety precautions and risks on your own to build a personal body of knowledge. The most effective safety precaution available to you is knowledge; the brain is the most important piece of safety equipment! This listing of advice for acetone handling is generated from the highlights of a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for acetone. After reading this advice you should read an MSDS for acetone directly. It would actually be an excellent idea to find and read the MSDS for all the chemicals you use during 3D printing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wear safety clothing! Acetone requires that you wear protective gloves, protective eyewear, and a respirator (to protect your airway). It is also highly recommended to wear protective (ideally also chemically resistant) clothing (like a smock or an apron). These safety clothes are recommended because acetone is a toxic substance which can absorb through the skin and walls of the lungs directly. Make sure to verify the gloves are made of a substance which blocks acetone absorption, also, verify that your respirator is rated to protect against acetone (many respirators are not capable of blocking acetone due to it's volatility).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possess, prepare and understand how to use an eyewash station, a fire blanket, a fire extinguisher (rated for chemical fires), a chemical shower/dousing system and other standard laboratory safety equipment. Posting warning signs along the entrances and exits to the work area about working with a volatile, flammable and explosive gas is also recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep an inert absorption media readily available to cleanup spills should you accidentally fail to avoid a spill. Diatomaceous earth, silica/sand and activated charcoal are all potential absorption media. Should you have a large spill or not possess absorption media (which should not happen - always verify safety equipment is present and working before handling chemicals!) then you may also dilute the spill with water and mop up the dilute solution of acetone. No matter which method you use to cleanup a spill remember to dispose of the contaminated cleanup materials according to the requirements/laws of your local area. &lt;strong&gt;Do not&lt;/strong&gt; lazily dispose of the acetone down the drain without doing research on the correct disposal methods!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control Your Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure proper ventilation of your workspace (ventilation is required in addition to your respirator due to explosion/fire risk). If the atmospheric concentration of acetone becomes too high the risk for fires and explosions quickly becomes unacceptable (the risk is never going to be zero working with acetone unfortunately, but minimizing it is very important). Working outside is the perfect way to insure the ventilation is adequate, although that presents it's own problems and considerations. Alternatives include using a fume hood, or even something as simple as a fan blowing air through an open window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminate any and all sources of flame or spark for a considerable area around all sources of acetone (10-15 meters minimum). Take special precautions to prevent being unknowingly contaminated with acetone (which could then be accidentally transported from the work area to a flame source using you as a carrier). Personal contamination can lead to injury if you attempt to smoke during a break or at anytime before verifying you are not contaminated. It is important to provide an ignition-free environment that extends quite far away from the immediate vicinity of the acetone because acetone can ignite a vapor trail of acetone and allow the flame to travel distances via flashing over the vapor trail. Physical isolation is the ideal solution to this dangerous problem. A policy of always closing the door to the acetone work area is an example of physical separation which would hopefully prevent this vapor trail flash-over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid acetone spills. Acetone is an excellent solvent which could easily eat away the paint on your wall or destroy the finish of your table. Spills also necessitate following special precautions for cleanup and disposal, which have already been provided earlier within this list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acetone Chemistry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not under any condition mix your acetone with chemicals without an extensive analysis and understanding of the products and the risks associated with the reaction. The following list of chemicals will create an explosive compound/mixture when reacted with acetone, so do not allow them to come into contact with acetone: hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, nitric acid, nitric acid + sulfuric acid, chromic anydride, chromyl&#xA;chloride, nitrosyl chloride, hexachloromelamine, nitrosyl perchlorate, nitryl perchlorate, permonosulfuric acid, thiodiglycol +&#xA;hydrogen peroxide, potassium ter-butoxide, sulfur dichloride, 1-methyl-1,3-butadiene, bromoform, carbon, air, chloroform,&#xA;thitriazylperchlorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should you accidentally ignite some acetone, you must take additional precautions while evacuating or while attempting to extinguish the fire. Acetone is a hydrocarbon and the reaction of burning it produces products which include carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Essentially, humans are incapable of detecting these gases with their senses (detectors exist to measure concentration). However, these symptoms of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide can help alert you to the fact they are present: shortness of breath, blackness along the edges of your vision, confusion, headache, unconsciousness, coma, and finally, death. Carbon monoxide is far more dangerous than carbon dioxide because often the first symptom is unconsciousness, which prevents you from evacuating, leading to death. The dangerous of gas inhalation are substantial enough that as soon as a fire becomes medium-sized you should seriously consider evacuating the area rather than staying to extinguish the fire. It is better to lose property to the fire than to die (if you die I would guess that your property is destroyed anyway!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetone is a confirmed developmental toxin for females and a suspected developmental toxin for males as well. The risk of breast milk contamination is unknown, but it is a suspected toxic contaminant. Mutagenic and tetragenic effects are not known. The result of this toxicity is that pregnant or breastfeeding women should not handle or be around acetone (due to vapors) even for short periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of cancer and the carcinogenic properties for acetone are not well-defined, with some declining to classify acetone as a carcinogen and others classifying it as being carcinogenic. California, for instance, has required that acetone bear a proposition 65 warning about cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetone is definitely a toxic substance, but it is not highly toxic and accidental ingestion or absorption is essentially incapable of causing severe symptoms. Small exposures to acetone (like the exposure levels likely encountered during 3D printing) are more-or-less not very harmful. However, if you do get a problematic exposure to acetone, contact a poison control center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LD50 (&quot;lethal dose 50%&quot;, dose where half of subjects die) in rats is 5800 mg/kg, making the predictable (humans are often similar to rats in regards to toxicity) LD50 for an adult human similarly high. With such a high lethal dose, the predicted toxicity of acetone likely causes chronic sub-lethal damage instead of causing an acute and lethal response. If we assume an average adult human (62 kg) shares the LD50 of a rat- that human would need to consume 392 cc of acetone to reach the LD50. 392 cc is nearly equivalent to 4/10 L- meaning that there is essentially no chance the small consumption of acetone caused by working with it could poison an adult human (if our assumptions are correct).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Potential effects of inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption of acetone:&lt;/em&gt; dry skin, nausea, vomiting, skin irritation, eye irritation, burning sensation, redness, tearing, inflammation, corneal injury, depression, fatigue, excitement, stupor, insomnia, hypersomnia, ataxia, tremors, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, headache, muscle weakness, loss of motor coordination, speech abnormalities, narcotic effects, coma, kidney damage, liver damage, brain damage, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="251" LastEditorUserId="251" LastEditDate="2016-01-16T22:26:55.593" LastActivityDate="2016-01-16T22:26:55.593" CommentCount="3" />

Here you'll have the option to set the speed in &lt;code&gt;mm/s or %&lt;/code&gt;. If you're having issues with the first layer (or two) not adhering very well to a raft, try reducing the distance between the part and the raft. Mine looks to be a default of 0.2mm. This can be adjusted from &lt;code&gt;Print Settings -&amp;gt; Support Material -&amp;gt; (Options for support material and raft) Contact Z distance&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please note that the closer the part is to the raft, the more likely the part is to sticking to the raft once it cools. So, I would recommend being close by as the part finished so you can quickly remove the raft before it cools with the part.

Generally, the differences are minimal, however:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Generally speaking, a 1.75mm filament will make it easier to use a smaller nozzle diameter (&amp;lt;0.4mm), allowing for more precise prints in some cases.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1.75mm filament will give you better flexibility with flow rates as it has a higher surface to volume ratio, allowing for faster melting in the nozzle, and allowing you to push your printer to higher volume extrusion rates.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The converse of the above points is also usually true. &quot;3mm&quot; filament (which is usually actually 2.85mm) will allow for better control and higher extrusion rates on wider nozzle diameters.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1.75mm filament is indeed more popular than 2.85mm, however the smaller diameter means that manufacturing tolerances really need to be tighter along the length of the filament—a ±0.1mm difference in width along the length of your filament is only ±3.5% for 2.85mm and more like ±6.7% for 1.75mm, so you're going to have a bigger difference in actual flow rates compared to your expected flow rate set in your slicer, resulting in lower-than-expected print quality. That means you're probably going to want to spring for more expensive, higher quality 1.75mm filament in order to get good prints.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Your printer's hardware setup matters, too: Bowden-based printers, like the Ultimaker 2, generally have more luck with the thicker filament because thinner stuff will usually compress more in the bowden tube and create a stronger spring effect, causing extra pressure in the nozzle. This will often cause blobbing, stringing, and over-extrusion and hamper the positive effect of your retractions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, you can tune your printer and slicer settings to create or negate most any of the differences in print quality caused by filament diameter, but you may have an easier time with certain prints and printers with one diameter over the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2016-01-16T18:46:49.003" CommentCount="0" />

Some printers have a pause capability, while others do not. Some have multiple extruders, while most do not. Some have a tube leading to the extruder and others do not. You specifically are asking about dealing with more than two colors when you have a dual-extruder, but the question generalizes to how to get more colors than you have extruders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Markers probably offer the easiest solution. You could have different markers on the feeds for each extruder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For printers with no pause ability, you might have to snip one filament and hand feed the second color after the first one until it can be caught by the feeder gear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are rigs that are available, or that you can make, that will let you connect two strands together lengthwise. You can then make up a single piece of filament that has multiple colors. Thus, one extruder head will be generating multiple colors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Kickstarter mentioned elsewhere essentially does this automatically for several strands whose lengths are calculated precisely by special software.

The answer is that gravity does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have any real affect on the stick-to-itivity of the filament. Instead, the plastic bonds to the print bed surface, and then subsequent layers fuse with the previous layer. Nor does gravity have any affect on how the filament is fed or how the belts and gears move. Certain filament roll holders may not be able to be used if they do not clamp the roll down, and the printer also needs to be clamped down.

One of my pet peeves is when people upload STLs that have been adjusted to fit their printer/material.

You'll have more luck with models from other people and have an easier time designing your own.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you still have trouble then modifying the model is probably the last option.  I don't know of any CAD programs that can work with problems 3D printers have so experience is going to be your only help.

As such, we should treat it and it's process similarly to other pieces of manufacturing equipment (ie mills, saws, etc.). Other (albeit traditional) manufacturing methods such as a mill will typically require post-processing to parts to remove any burrs and clean the parts. Since tools like a mill are a subtractive technology, it can already hold tight positional/dimensional tolerances. However, as 3D printing is additive manufacturing, it's difficult to hold the same tolerances directly out of the machine as compared to traditional tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I would suggest planning time for a more traditional process after the print if tolerances and connections are a concern. This could be as simple as using a Dremel or using a mill/lathe. I would recommend increasing your shell/floor/roof settings in your slicer to accommodate the subtractive process though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2016-01-18T15:27:53.853" CommentCount="2" />

  <row Id="355" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="204" CreationDate="2016-01-20T16:40:01.790" Score="3" Body="&lt;p&gt;Thermocouples work by passively generating VERY small voltages via the Seebeck effect -- usually a few tens of millivolts. They're literally just a pair of wires made from two different special alloys, electrically connected together at the &quot;hot&quot; end. That wire junction can be mounted inside whatever kind of attachment tip or lug is desired.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that they're very simple and passive devices makes them extremely precise and consistent between TCs of the same type, MUCH more so than thermistors. Any type-K thermocouple in the world will give you the same accurate output +/-1-2C or so. You can even cut a thermocouple in half, re-twist the ends of the wires together, and it'll still work! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the very small (millivolts) signal they generate is quite susceptible to electrical noise and circuit design. The signal voltage has to be greatly amplified to be useful. So it doesn't take much EMR from your heater or stepper wires to interfere with the TC reading. A frequent problem with TC circuits in 3d printers is the dreaded GROUND LOOP -- if the &quot;hot&quot; tip is electrically connected to the hot block, voltage and current on the heater and motor wires can induce small currents through the TC wires that totally screw up the millivolt signal. The amplifier picks up these stray voltages and it throws off the temp read. So, there are some important guidelines for keeping noise out of the TC wires:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The TC wires must be electrically insulated from the mounting hardware (eye lug, thermowell, whatever your extruder has). You can check this with a multimeter -- you want infinite / out of range resistance from the TC leads to the mounting tip and hot block. While you're at it, make sure your heater cartridge wires aren't shorting to the hot block -- that's unsafe and can also cause problems with TCs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Keep the two TC wires close together, and not immediately parallel to noise sources like PWM-controlled heaters or stepper wiring. If you must run the TC in a bundle with the other wires, TWIST the heater/stepper wiring pairs. (For steppers, twist each coil pair to a different pitch if possible. You don't need to twist the separate coil pairs to each other.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another common issue with TC circuits is the COLD JUNCTION COMPENSATION. A thermocouple doesn't measure tip temperature, it measures the DIFFERENCE in temperature between the hot tip and the cold junction where the TC is connected to either the amp or copper wiring. The TC amp has an onboard thermistor that it uses to add the temp at the cold junction to the measured signal from the thermocouple. There are a few things you need to do to make sure the cold-junction compensation works properly:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You should run TC wire all the way from the &quot;hot&quot; tip to the TC amp. You CAN splice it and install plugs, but only with more type-K TC wire and proper type-K thermocouple plugs. These use the same metal as the TC wire so they don't generate undesired junction voltages that interfere with the TC signal. If you splice copper wire between the TC and the amp, any temp differences along the copper will not be measured! This is a particularly big problem if you splice to copper inside a warm enclosure and then run copper to an amp outside the enclosure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The amp should not be super hot. The onboard thermistor is designed to accurately measure temperatures reasonably close to room temp, not hot-block temps. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There should not be large temperature gradients near the amp or between the TC wire termination and the actual amp chip. Place the amp far enough away from the hot end and other heat sources (like stepper motors) that it isn't experiencing weird temp profiles.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do the above, the TC will output a good signal, and the amp will read it properly. But there's one more hitch. The mainboard has to know how to understand the amp's output. 3D printer control boards that are designed exclusively for TCs, like Mightyboards, usually use digital communication between the amp and the main control chip (MCU). This is high-reliability and does not require any special firmware configuration -- support is baked in. But if you're strapping an external TC amp onto a board that is expecting thermistors, &lt;strong&gt;you will have to tell the firmware how to read the signal from the amp.&lt;/strong&gt; The most common technique is for the amp to output a linear voltage signal to the MCU's normal thermistor input (ADC). Then you configure the firmware to use the appropriate &quot;thermistor table&quot; (really a voltage lookup table) for that particular amp.

There's a lot of software-specific advice out there, like printing a single-wall calibration box and measuring the wall thickness. That's a good technique for Slic3r, but not for Simplify3D. It can be very confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's the general outline of what you should do:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rough calibration check&lt;/strong&gt; for printer steps/mm. Do the values in your firmware settings make sense for your linear motion hardware? For example, you can calculate what the theoretical values SHOULD be based on belt pitch and pulley tooth count. Print something moderately big (~100-200mm) and check if it's +/-1-2%. If it's off by more than that, your steps/mm is probably wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check for mechanical backlash&lt;/strong&gt; using a backlash-checking print like this one: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:252490&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:252490&lt;/a&gt; Tighten belts and perform other printer-specific tuning required to eliminate backlash. Backlash will throw off other calibration steps, so make sure there's no slop!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Follow the recommended &lt;strong&gt;extrusion volume calibration&lt;/strong&gt; steps for your slicer. This starts with measuring your filament diameter with calipers and inputting that into your slicer. And then you will usually either &lt;em&gt;&quot;print a single-walled box and measure the thickness&quot;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&quot;print a series of 100% infill calibration boxes and adjust the extrusion multiplier to the largest value that looks good without bulging.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; By measuring filament diameter and then adjusting an extrusion calibration setting in the slicer, you will be able to measure future filament and prints will come out right. Giving the slicer fake diameter values will force you to recalibrate every time the diameter changes. Note that you must redo this calibration for each FILAMENT MATERIAL and EXTRUDER DESIGN. Different material/extruder pairs will have different bite depths and effective drive diameter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision calibration check&lt;/strong&gt; by printing a variety of object sizes and PLOTTING &quot;desired size&quot; as X and &quot;actual size&quot; as Y. Then find a linear fit equation, y=mx+b. (Do this separately for your printer's X, Y, and Z axes.) &lt;em&gt;The value &quot;m&quot; is your scale error.&lt;/em&gt; You can use your slicer object scaling to fix this. For example, ABS usually requires 100.3-101% scaling to account for shrinkage. If you have scale error with a low-shrinkage material like PLA, you can adjust your firmware's steps/mm value to compensate. &lt;em&gt;The value &quot;b&quot; is your fixed width error.&lt;/em&gt; Assuming you don't have backlash, this is usually caused by the small amount that molten plastic bulges out to the sides, or by extrusion volume calibration error. You can improve this by fine-tuning your extrusion volume. Many slicers also have &quot;horizontal/XY size compensation&quot; settings that you can use to shrink/expand the part by b/2 to correct the fixed width error. Any residual fixed-width error that you cannot correct with slicer settings should be added as a tolerance in your part models. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you follow these steps, you should get +/-0.1mm or better dimensional precision on your prints.*&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*Deltas not included.

But we don't need to get into that right now. There are really two big things to worry about: layer height and extrusion width.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Layer heights of 0.1mm or 0.2mm should be fine. Coarser layers may run into surface finish issues that make the bricks difficult to put together or take apart. There probably isn't much reason to go finer than 0.1mm for this application. Almost all FFF printers can do 0.1mm layer heights as long as it is reasonably well-tuned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any typical household FFF printer with a &quot;normal&quot; nozzle size can print fine enough for the bricks to work. It just needs to be tuned well.&lt;/strong&gt; The smallest &quot;must have&quot; feature in a standard lego brick is the 1.6mm thick wall around the sides. The typical minimum printable feature size for an FFF printer is 2x the extrusion width, because the slicer will place a path on the inside edge of the shape and the outside edge of the shape. (Some slicers will allow single-extrusion features, but this is not generally recommended because it makes weak parts.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, how wide is the extrusion width? It's adjustable, and different slicers auto-recommend different values, but as a safe rule of thumb it needs to be between 1x and 2x your nozzle size. There are some volume calculation quirks in different slicers that may encourage larger or smaller sizes, so sometimes people recommend [extrusion width = nozzle size + layer height] particularly with Slic3r. This is very system-specific. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have the most common stock nozzle with a 0.4mm orifice, and also set the extrusion width to 0.4mm, the slicer should put four strands in the walls of the LEGO brick. That's good. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where it gets tricky is if you have an extrusion width that does not evenly divide into 1.6mm. Say you are printing with an extrusion width of 0.6mm. There is enough room in the wall of the part to place two full 0.6mm perimeter strands... but then a gap 0.4mm wide will be left in the center. You can't put another 0.6mm strand into that 0.4mm gap. Different slicers handle this different ways. Some will leave an empty space between the walls, and you get a very weak print. Some will mash an excessive amount of plastic into the gap, causing poor print quality as excess material builds up more and more on each layer. Some will push a smaller-than-commanded strand to try to properly fill the volume. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the general advice with small features is to make sure your extrusion width goes into the part's minimum thickness a reasonable number of times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[Feature size / extrusion width &amp;lt; 2] is BAD  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[Feature size / extrusion width = 2] is GOOD &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[2 &amp;lt; Feature size / extrusion width &amp;lt; 3] is BAD &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[Feature size / extrusion width &gt; 3] is GOOD&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although these will vary somewhat by slicer -- older slicers like Skeinforge tend to have more issues with this than newer slicers. What you should do in practice is check your slicer's print previewer to see whether it is leaving a gap between the strands. Then adjust extrusion width and perimeter/shell count to try to get an intelligent output.

You can't just open a window to air out the molten-ABS smell from the ISS! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FFF printers put out fumes and nanoparticles. In a space station, the same air gets recycled over and over, and the air purification systems have a specific set of contaminants that they are optimized for, as well as a design capacity for air turnover and chemical removal rates that won't be adjusted just because somebody's printing a space-ratchet today. Protecting cabin air quality is a huge design factor for any experiment that goes into space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Made in Space printing experiments on the ISS to date were performed in one of the vacuum experiment chambers, so any unfiltered fumes (or fire flare-ups) could be vented directly to space if required. In the long run, this isn't going to work -- other experiments may need the vacuum chamber, or &quot;production&quot; printers may be too large to fit. So the printer needs to have its own internal air purification system. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another MAJOR design constraint is launch survival. Rocket payloads must be designed for extreme g-forces without 1) damage, or 2) significant internal shifting of mass which would affect the payload center of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Total payload weight is also quite important here: lifting mass to low Earth orbit is EXPENSIVE. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the microgravity environment itself isn't that big of a deal. Molten plastic is highly viscous and pretty much stays where you put it long enough to solidify, as long as it's sticking to something. But two impacts do come to mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First, an unsecured filament spool will try to unwind itself. Gravity won't provide the contact friction we usually rely on to keep spools from bird's-nesting. (Think about it: a tightly-wound spool is literally a giant coil-spring.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Second, heat flows are different in microgravity -- you can't rely on passive convection to cool the print or the motors. Accommodations must be made for sufficient forced airflow and heat-sinking on anything that requires cooling. And that includes the enclosure itself, since, as mentioned above, the print chamber must be sealed up tight for air quality control. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, reliability is critical. Amazon doesn't deliver to the ISS (yet). Even a single stripped screw may take the printer out of commission for months until a replacement part can be fit into an upcoming supply launch. Having the printer catch on fire because something shorted would be catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, really, it's all about making a printer robust enough to make it up there, operate safely, and never break.

It will &quot;work&quot; in the sense that your printer will get power, but it won't provide anywhere near as much protection as a lower-rated fuse. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;10A is a lot of current for mains voltage. Depending on what else you have plugged in, there is a fair chance your home's 15A breaker will trip before this fuse does, which kind of defeats the point of having it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even for &quot;fast&quot; fuses, it takes a significant amount of time for them to blow when conducting their rated current. The internal fusible link has to heat up and melt before the fuse stops conducting. The less the overload current exceeds the rating, the longer that takes. A 10A fuse conducting a 10.5A short might take 30 seconds to trip. In the meantime, your printer is melting. Lower-rated fuses will trip faster for the same short and thus provide better protection. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You need to size fuses as small as possible for the required current draw if you want to have any hope of rapidly cutting off an excessive-current event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would recommend a 4A fuse in the USA for this 350w power supply. (Note: the listing title says 360 but the photos show 350.) I use 4A fuses in several printers with 120v / 350w PSUs and they do not trip. But you can do the math for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;350 watts / 120 volts / 80% efficiency = 3.64A&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The smallest fuse you can find that is larger than this value is what you should use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, we can argue over whether 80% is the right efficiency value... it could be lower. The PSU label says 6.5A input is required, but that amount of current draw implies either a &amp;lt;50% efficiency (which is quite poor for this kind of PSU) or would only occur for abuse/surge scenarios like starting very large motors. Such short-lived inrush events generally won't trip a fuse unless you do something dumb like lock the rotor. And none of that applies to the small microstepping-driver stepper motor systems we're working with here. This PSU should not draw more than 4A in normal 3D printer use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at this on the other end -- how much damage will 10A do versus 4A? Lots. If the short is in the 12v system, and the PSU's short protection doesn't trip in (because it's a cheap knock-off) you would roughly multiply the AC fuse current times 10 to get the DC current. And 40A is a downright scary amount of current! Depending on wire gauge, putting 40A through heatbed wiring may make it smell and smoke. Whereas putting 100A through heatbed wiring will almost certainly start a fire. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're much safer with a 4A or even 6A fuse for this PSU than a 10A fuse. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-01-21T04:38:42.443" CommentCount="12" />

So you can use Makerbot slicing profiles for the Replicator 1. Just keep in mind that Makerbot does not generally test new software revs with their older printers, and DEFINITELY does not test new software revs with competitor knock-offs. Sometimes they appear to break functionality for non-Makerbot machines on purpose. So recent versions of Makerbot Desktop may not &quot;play nice&quot; with your FlashForge. &lt;strong&gt;The most recent &quot;known good&quot; free slicer you should use with this printer is Makerware 2.4.x. You can find links by searching the FF Google Group.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On that note, you may have received instructions to use ReplicatorG with your printer. But RepG is abandonware: development stopped years ago. It should only be used for firmware updates, not as a slicer. You should also only use the most recent version posted on the Sailfish page on Thingiverse: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32084&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32084&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using older versions of RepG with newer firmware revs will corrupt your EEPROM! Only use the version downloaded from the link above. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The firmware that comes with the printer is FlashForge's slightly-customized build of either Sailfish or Makerbot's Replicator 1/2/2x firmware. But here's the trick: Makerbot's Rep1/2/2x firmware is just an old, out-of-date, slightly customized version of Sailfish. Makerbot stopped keeping up with bug-fixes and feature additions a long time ago. &lt;strong&gt;Everything is Sailfish:&lt;/strong&gt; just different versions. You should use the most recent official release version listed at:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sailfishfirmware.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.sailfishfirmware.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Follow the instructions in the Sailfish manual from the link above, and RepG will automatically pull the right builds from the official mirror and populate a list of printer options to choose. The trick here is which build to download. As of 1-21-16, there is not an official Monoprice Architect build yet. Which would mean editing a machine xml profile to avoid the firmware throwing warnings. I STRONGLY recommend getting used to the printer using factory firmware before trying to fight with custom machine profiles... But here is the basic process to pick a Sailfish firmware build when you're ready:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First: which Atmega processor version do you have? The large chip in the middle of the control board will either say 1280 or 2560. You need to know which version you have. Bad things happen if you load the wrong version.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second: What is the tooth count on the X and Y drivetrain pulleys? To my knowledge, FF always uses 17-tooth pulleys, which matches the Replicator 1 and FF Creator profiles. The Rep2 and 2x use 18t pulleys, so only use those builds if you have those pulleys. People often mess this up and their prints end up with dimensions ~5% off in X and Y. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third: The Architect has one extruder and no heatbed, so firmware builds that expect those to be connected (Rep 1 Dual, Creator, etc) will throw errors if loaded. You can fix this from the LCD screen or RepG, but that's a whole separate question. Do some printing and learn about the printer before attempting any firmware update so you'll know what to do if you pick a build with the wrong parts. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fourth: This one is just for the sake of completeness. Some FF models were shipped with off-spec heatbeds that require special firmware builds to prevent drawing too much current and overheating / overloading the power supply. The Architect doesn't have that, but firmware builds for those printer models (eg I believe the FF Creator 2560) will under-power regular heatbeds. This is just something you need to know with the Architect if you decide to install a heatbed later. But it's a really critical safety warning for people with those off-spec heatbeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this all seems complicated, that's because FlashForge (and in turn Monoprice) relies heavily on the open source Sailfish project to maintain the software ecosystem behind this line of printers. FlashForge has some internal builds that they use for flashing new bots, but these are not kept particularly up-to-date. Nor does FlashForge release the source files, so it's quite opaque where exactly the stock firmware differs from mainstream Sailfish. In the long run, you should install mainline Sailfish. But it's ok to stick with the factory firmware until you get used to the printer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To summarize: Because there is not an existing Sailfish build, you're going to need to do some investigating and some experimenting to figure out which build will work.

That is, by far, the slowest part of SLA/DLP printing with most modern light sources. Where the speed comes in is that without a peel, a continuous &quot;movie&quot; can be used to cure the resin rather than a series of alternating images and peels. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Top-down printers can print dramatically faster than bottom-up-and-peel printers.

(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gizmo3dprinters.com.au/&quot;&gt;http://www.gizmo3dprinters.com.au/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most &quot;consumer&quot; SLA printers these days use bottom-up-and-peel techniques, because this has some practical advantages over top-down printers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Way less resin is required to fill the printer when the part is pulled out as it builds rather than being lowered into the tank (along with the Z stage) as it builds. Resin is expensive. This also means bottom up printers can be smaller and have fewer mechanical parts such as leveling devices submerged in resin. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Standard resins contain an inhibitor chemical that prevents polymerization in the presence of oxygen, which causes the surface layer exposed to air (and low-level stray light) to not cure. So top-down printers must shoot light through a non-curing layer before reaching curable resin. This makes the tuning more sensitive and can somewhat reduce detail compared to a bottom-up printer curing right on the window.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Replacement vats or windows for bottom-up printers may be seen by manufacturers as a profit-generating consumable, since they have to be replaced somewhat frequently.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Top-down printers have to worry somewhat more about resin flow rates as the part is lowered. Air bubbles may be pulled into the resin or the fresh resin layer above the part may vary significantly in thickness if the part is submerged too fast for the resin viscosity. (Admittedly, bottom-up printers will experience excessive suction forces and potentially break off bits of the print at high peel speeds.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CLIP is a bottom-up technique that doesn't require a peel step, because the vat creates an oxygen layer over the window that keeps the resin from curing directly on the surface and sticking. In that way, it arguably performs more like a top-down printer than a bottom-up printer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Top-down printers that are designed to overcome the above issues and use high-intensity light sources can achieve exceptionally high print speeds. This includes similar &quot;continuous&quot; build techniques used as in CLIP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-01-21T22:16:38.140" CommentCount="0" />

Can you just print the hole into the part instead of drilling? That's usually best, when possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you need to drill, you'll definitely want to print an undersized hole and then ream it out with the drill. This both provides alignment for the drill and adds extra plastic around the region you'll be weakening. If you don't know where the hole needs to go in advance, fill the model with a hex pattern of tiny holes in the general region of the future drilling. This is an easy way to strengthen the area with more plastic without making the entire part solid. (Using a slicer that allows localized print settings will also work.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hole should be aligned more or less vertical or &quot;across the grain&quot; (+/-45 degrees aligned with the Z axis) to ensure there are nice, strong hoops of plastic around the hole to keep it from splitting.

It may even be ok at first but crack later under load or due to creep. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regular wood drill bits work ok, but you need to go slow and take nibbles, leaving the plastic time to cool so it doesn't melt and stick to the bit.

Besides being available gift-wrapped, it&#xA;states the following feature:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You can choose the input voltage (110V/240V) by switch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;110V ≈ 120V, which means the &lt;strong&gt;device voltage matches your supply&#xA;voltage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The supply can deliver 30A at 12V on the DC side which means 360W.&#xA;If it could transform the electricity ideally, without any&#xA;inefficiency, that would be &lt;strong&gt;3A&lt;/strong&gt; at 120V on the AC side. But your&#xA;supply is unlikely ideal. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply#SMPS_and_linear_power_supply_comparison&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia suggests 60-95% efficiency&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;Let's be super pessimistic and assume 50%. That means half the power&#xA;that goes into the switch power supply is turned into heat. In order&#xA;to still get the 360W out, you have to insert 720W. That means&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;your device draws 6A&lt;/strong&gt; on the AC side.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What does this all mean for your wire?&#xA;What wire size do you need for this supply?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, the above link to the amazon website showing your power supply also suggests the following PC ATX power supplies to me:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00SN6VN7W&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sentey Power Supply 725 Watt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00I3IXEBI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sentey Power Supply 1000 Watt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's get this straight: You can buy a power supply for a PC and plug it into your outlet without even thinking about what a wire size is. You'd just plug and play. &lt;strong&gt;That PC power supply will potentially draw more current&lt;/strong&gt; than &lt;strong&gt;the power supply of your 3D printer&lt;/strong&gt;. A standard wire would be able to supply either one of the PC ATX power supplies linked above and would not have a problem delivering a lower current to the power supply of your 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The switching supply doesn't have a plug like a PC ATX supply, but that on its own doesn't make it any less secure (if wired up properly). It's just less common for household appliances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I'd like to avoid a fire, or damage to the house wiring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's a good and valid concern. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PC Power supplies deliver 12V and supply more than enough current (like the examples above). They are probably in use in your house already and did neither set it on fire nor damage the house wiring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A switching mode power supply is just as secure and if bought from a known brand unlikely to do you any harm either if used properly and within its specifications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultimately&lt;/strong&gt;, this is not a question of secure electricity but a trade-off between secure electricity and the price to pay for it.

The first thing is to check continuity: find 2 pairs of wires, which are the ends of two separate coils. If your motors have more than 4 wires it's trickier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With RAMPS (see handy diagram at &lt;a href=&quot;http://makerdev.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ramps_fanboard_annotations.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://makerdev.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ramps_fanboard_annotations.jpg&lt;/a&gt;), the 4 pins are commonly labelled (starting from the one nearest the power-supply end of the RAMPS board):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2B 2A 1A 1B&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It means coil 1 and coil 2, each of which has ends A and B.

ABS and HIPS incorporate polybutadiene into a graft polymer structure for a very good reason: the butadiene sections in the long molecular chains kind of &quot;stick together&quot; as a distinct solid phase to produce what amounts to micro-bubbles of rubber inside a matrix of hard styrene or acrylonitrile-styrene plastic. This compound microstructure is what gives HIPS and ABS favorable impact toughness and some minor flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The flexibility is important -- the stiffer a filament is, the more it will tend to warp while printing. Based on chemistry alone, I would expect styrene to be somewhat more prone to warping than ABS. And it would certainly be more brittle.

If you have sandpaper made out of metal (ie stainless pla), it will scratch your skin fairly easily. If you have sandpaper made out of tree bark (ie laywood pla), it probably won't scratch your skin as bad, but it'll still scratch. And just for poops and giggles, lets say you have sandpaper made out of pla; it'll take a while, but you could eventually make your skin raw if you rub the plastic against your arm long enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is typically recommended to use one nozzle for each material type as to avoid cross-contamination of materials in your printing. With this idea in mind, if you are using many types of materials, you can also minimize failed prints due to clogging and other &quot;damaged nozzle&quot; type troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2016-02-01T16:16:38.337" CommentCount="0" />

Metal printing requires significantly higher temperatures than plastic, and the two processes are so incompatible that there is currently no good solutions that would allow one printer to print both in the same print.

You might, for instance, use a ceramic paste extruder, then change the head for the next print using plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There have been efforts in the past, and some efforts are ongoing, to resolve this.  For instance wood's metal, a low temperature alloy, can be poured at temperatures compatible with plastics, so it's possible to create a printer that prints plastic, leaving troughs or voids in the plastic, then the same printer during this print would pour molten woods metal into these areas, which then solidifies into an internal metal structure.  These are intended for circuitry and electrical use, however significant problems still exist because the thermal expansion differences in these materials lead to stress and result in poor reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So while some of these processes are being developed, this is still just in the experimental stage and there are significant problems to overcome before printers can print widely different materials in a single printing session.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course you can find plastics with such a wide range of characteristics that they can be seen as printing different materials.

Prusa i3).&#xA;On some 3d printers you need to rotate a screw with a screwdriver to adjust it (eg Solidoodle 3) and on some you have a nut (mostly wing nut) (eg. Solidoodle 4).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find most people move the extruder around when adjusting the bed by controlling the motors. I think the quicker way is stopping the motors (in Repetier Host it's the &quot;Stop Motor&quot; button) and moving the gantry by hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tutorial: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED1Gxvw2Rmw&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED1Gxvw2Rmw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Second one is just more advanced version of the above. You use a dial indicator/ micrometer attached to your extruder and make sure the number on the dial is as close as possible on all edges.&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI6eKDUzdfA&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI6eKDUzdfA&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K19BaqhYD0c&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K19BaqhYD0c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also digital versions of this tool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might need to print or make someother way a piece to be able to attach a micrometer to the extruder (there might be one for your 3d printer on Thingiverse already).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, remember I mentioned that you adjust the height of the edges of the print bed with a screw/nut? Well, since there is a lot of vibration during print those tend to get out of place and that might explain why you end up readjusting it over and over again. What I have found to solve this is to use a single drop of loctite (cyanocrylate glue) in the middle of the nut/screw. A single drop will secure it in place but also not make it impossible to unscrew in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) Setting up auto-bed leveling on your 3d printer if it's moddable enough.&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGFLwj0pnA&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGFLwj0pnA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you can't get the bed leveled no matter what, it might be uneven. That's usually caused by warping. Both PCB beds and alumnum beds can get warped. With the former just sandwitch a glass bed on top of it and it should be fine. Warped aluminum is pretty hard to flatten. In this extreme situation you might need to get a new aluminum sheet cut and drilled, preferrably a mm thicker one which is less likely to warp under the same conditions.

Same true for infill).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) Smaller nozzle disadvantage (varies, debatable): higher risk of clogging. There are of course other factors which can result in clogging, but this can also affect it as even finer particles in less quality filament can get stuck now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) Smallel nozzle disadvantage: since less plastic can come out at a given duration of time, it means less speedy printing of larger layer heights, if at all possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel like I should get back to (1) and explain why it is so.&#xA;When companies market their 3d printer they usually talk about the layer height (the Z resolution) completely ignoring the X and Y. This makes sense for marketing. Luckily it is not hard to explain what is usually left out and what is important for one of the answers to your question on what are advantages of smaller nozzles:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Z resolution depends on two main things:&#xA;1) The stepper motor driver accuracy of your 3d printer's motherboard. Pretty much all are the same now. Claiming your 3d printer can print at 20 micron layer height doesn't say anything, pretty much any 3d printed today can.&#xA;2) Nozzle/extruder quality, nozzle diameter. The latter surprisingly does not determine much. Because of how FFF/FMD 3d printing works, the perimeters of your 3d print can be way thinner than your nozzle diameter. This might sound odd but there's a simple explanation: the molten plastic coming out of the hotend is squished and stretched when the head moves. Because it is stretched, it can be made thinner as you increase how much it is squished. There's not much experimentation done on this and available online, only from personal experience I can say I can print perimeters 50% thinner than my 3mm nozzle. So I suppose if you wanted thinner perimeters than that, you would need to swap to a thinner nozzle.&#xA;Why would you want thinner perimeters? To get sharper corners or in other words better X and Y resolution for your 3d prints which is ignored by most unlike the overstated &quot;layer height&quot; (Z resolution).&#xA;Here's an illustration to help you visualize how fatter perimeters and less sharp corners/edges on your 3d model result in &quot;lower X/Y resolution&quot; (the illustration is a 2d cutout, viewed from the top):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/E9Q38.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/E9Q38.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="381" LastEditorUserId="381" LastEditDate="2016-02-06T02:18:17.257" LastActivityDate="2016-02-06T02:18:17.257" CommentCount="2" />

That causes poor layer bonding and weaker prints. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The flow of molten plastic coming out of the nozzle must be drawn down by tension in order to end up smaller than the nozzle opening, and that drawing effect makes it difficult to get good contact with the previous layer. So you end up with a &quot;stack of logs&quot; structure kind of like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/MwRXM.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/MwRXM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;0.4mm wide by 0.4mm tall strands through a 0.4mm nozzle&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;(This photo actually shows layer height = extrusion width = nozzle size, which is another no-no, but the end result is similar.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you want instead is something very &quot;mashed together&quot; and strong like this:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/zqaDx.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/zqaDx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;0.4mm wide by 0.4mm tall strands through a 0.4mm nozzle&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How finely the the strand can draw down -- versus smearing or breaking apart into blobs -- will depend greatly on the type of filament and the printing conditions. For example, nylon draws down extremely well because it experiences a large degree of strain crystallization, and actually gets stronger and stiffer as it's stretched. PLA tends to get more brittle when strained and may break into stringy blobs. ABS doesn't change terribly much because it's highly amorphous. Polymer type, blending agents, print speed, printing temperature, and cooling will control the drawing behavior of the filament. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another factor to consider is what the strand spacing is within the print. If you set the extrusion width equal to half the nozzle width, depending on the slicer, adjacent strands may be placed with pitch equal or slightly less than half the nozzle width. So after the first strand is printed (say an unimportant inner perimeter) &lt;strong&gt;the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; strand will be printed with the nozzle partially overlapping the previous strand.&lt;/strong&gt; This effectively creates a constriction to force the plastic out of a smaller opening to one side of the nozzle, which is not too different from printing with a smaller nozzle. Subsequent perimeter strands may then tend to &quot;heal up&quot; even if the first is low quality. This effect doesn't completely fix the problem, but it helps account for why under-width strands seem to work better than they ought to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, even if the strands turn out ok, it's arguable whether there is any benefit. If the goal of a smaller extrusion width is more precision and sharper corners, you may not actually accomplish that goal. When the filament is being drawn down by tension in the cooling polymer, it may tend to &quot;cut corners&quot; and get pulled into a rounded arc when the nozzle changes direction. That may defeat the point of using a thinner extrusion width in the first place. Generally I only recommend using under-width strands to capture thin-wall detail that is only a little bit too thin for the nozzle, not as a way to improve overall print quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, having the extrusion width equal or wider than the nozzle ensures the plastic is firmly squished downward into intimate contact with the lower layer. You can fudge this a bit and still get decent results, but it's &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; best to keep the extrusion width equal or larger than the nozzle size. There's no hard cutoff where it will / won't work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-02-06T06:19:08.443" CommentCount="5" />

That explains why you use the Arduino IDE to update or modify their firmware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now why you would want to use an Arduino + an Arduino shield board like RAMPS? Well if you're not good at electronics, are happy with the cost of your own board, don't care much about upgrades/modding beyond what is possible with your board, maybe you shouldn't, it might be overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several advantages with using Arduino with a shield for your 3d printer, &quot;two boards are not just the predecessors of the one board solution&quot;, no.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) It is moddable/exandable/upgradable/has replacable parts.&#xA;If your printer came with its own motherboard that doesn't have additional or enough pins to add more fans, enclosure lights, a second extruder, an LCD and you want to, it sucks. RAMPS can do that, it has plenty of extra pins.&#xA;It is upgradable. You want to replace the stepper drivers with a new one? Or you accidentally damaged the one you have? Fear not, you can just replace that instead of the whole motherboard.&#xA;Think if it like other motherboards being PCs on which you can't change the CPU, RAM and GPU.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) It is here for a long time, you will be able to acquire one for a long time.&#xA;There isn't just one company making RAMPS or similar sheilds. Sometimes 3d printing companies go out of business or stop producing your particular motherboard. RAMPS is likely here to stay. Because Arduino is very likely here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) As said above, not just one company owns or makes RAMPS or other Arduino shields. Besides the possibility of your motherboard not being produced anymore, there's also the advantage of not being at the mercy of one companies pricing and shipping policies. This is true for some other boards as well though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) It is possibly cheaper than what have you. I don't want to post a link, but one company right now is selling their derivative of Printrboard for like $180. Check the cost of Arduino Mega, stepper drivers and a RAMPS board yourself, quite a difference. That said, there are some boards which are close in price.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5) It's an Arduino. Why is this a good thing by itself? Because many people who have a 3d printer are tinkerers/makers and they already use Arduino for other projects. It is open source with a rich library to control many things. The modding and upgrades for your 3d printer which can be done with Arduino is another level higher. Or it can be a good learning experience for your future Arduino projects. If on the other hand you already use Arduino and are experienced with it, you might use it just because you know how to control it/fix it better than some specialized board you haven't seen before.

Bridging is when you are printing between two solid pieces (like a bridge). Overhangs occur when printing off of a single solid piece and coming back. Most slicing engines allow extra settings for speed, fan power, etc for these parameters, just refer to this terminology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A very common and simple solution in getting features to 3D print properly is to just slow down! If you're not a in a rush to get the part done, you bring down all of the feedrates in your slicing engine. MakerWare has mine at 90/150 mm/s for print and rapid. Typically I'll bring that down to about 50/90. My reasoning is the more time you give the plastic to cool, both while and after printing the layer, the more rigid that layer will be for the next one. When briding or overhanging, there will typically be a sagged area in the print. You can minimize this by providing the plastic more time to cool. Also keep in mind that printing on supports is still technically bridging (printing between two solid pieces).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to keep in mind is adhesion from one layer to the next matter just as much between the current layer and the previous as the current strand to the one next to it. So, in some cases, increasing your shell could possibly make it easier for the infill/roof/floor strands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2016-02-07T17:30:29.193" CommentCount="2" />

I'm not sure if all slicing engines provide this option, but I know MakerWare/MakerBot Desktop and (possibly) Slic3r allow this setting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, when you're extruding smaller features like this, the previous layer(s) are still very hot and possibly very pliable. So, as your nozzle moves around above the previous layer, the nozzle may (and probably will) push some of this molten plastic around. Chances are you can see it to a certain degree while it's printing. You can definitely see this in a most drastic state if you print a tall and small diameter cylinder. You'll notice that the part will become almost exponentially unstable the higher it goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By increasing the time your printer takes to print a single layer, you are allowing the previous layer(s) to cool closer to the ambient temperature of the build space, and hopefully not as molten.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abcgroup3.com/toolbox/mold_cooling_calc.htm&quot;&gt;this calculator&lt;/a&gt; or a similar one for material cooling times. For a standard shell setting of about 2-3 (0.4mm nozzle) will yield about 130sec to cool down to room temperature. I would recommend (for ABS/PLA at least) about a 15second minimum for each layer, possibly longer depending on the size and spread out of the features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that this can be cheated by simply printing multiple items in the same build plate with the same heights (ie. multiples of the same part). Naturally, it will take longer for the machine to print the rest of the parts and therefore allow each layer to cool slightly before being printed over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Active Cooling&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, some slicing engines have an Active Cooling setting. I don't personally have this option setup on my machine, but I believe it regulates the flow of air directed at your nozzle (usually by use of a mounted fan). This can help cool the layers a bit faster. With ABS, this might result in some pretty bad warping mid-print.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Feedrates&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try bringing down your feedrates to provide the printed portions of the current layer more time to cool if the above options aren't available.

Performing kinematics and dynamics calculations while sending many thousands of precisely-synchronized step pulses per second is &lt;em&gt;really, really hard&lt;/em&gt;. The 8bit AVR line of microcontrollers used in older 3D printer controllers is basically a late-1990s era Mr Coffee processor. They are completely, utterly maxed out on processor time just executing basic printing functions in simple (eg Cartesian) printers, and adding additional calculation load will bog them down and cause slowdowns, stuttering, pausing, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But my 8bit printer works fine,&quot; you say. No, it doesn't. Your print performance is limited by it, whether you realize it or not. Slicers now automatically hide a lot of the firmware's performance shortcomings from you. For example, the standard practice of greatly slowing down print speeds on perimeters is largely a result of 8bit processors having inadequate resources for two things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Performing centripetal acceleration calculations for curves&#xA;across multiple gcode segments &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Keeping up with gcode transmission/processing and motion planning for gcode with lots of very small segments, such as in organic models or smooth arcs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When presented with a series of very small segments in a smooth arc or complex curve, the 8bit firmware will likely choke on the required command processing rate and introduce stuttering to the print. These incredibly brief pauses allow residual pressure in the extruder to push out some extra plastic, making a little zit on the print. So most slicers automatically decimate curves and output gcode with reduced resolution to lighten the load on the firmware. Problem solved, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there's another issue -- the GRBL motion control algorithms underlying all the major open source 3D printer controllers were designed with lots of shortcuts and hacks to allow 8bit processors to execute fast enough. For example, the basic algorithm only looks at the speed or velocity change at the corner between two segments, and uses that to decide when to decelerate/accelerate along the direction of motion. It does not calculate or consider centripetal/radial acceleration whatsoever. This is a really effective hack when printing boxy, low-res models, but it fails miserably on smooth curves with lots of little segments. The firmware does not detect any appreciable velocity change at the corner of any two nearly-linear segments within the faceted curve, and thus does not slow down for the curve. So complex geometry is effectively printed at constant velocity, with no acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Printing complex perimeters unaccelerated means the commanded feedrate must be very low to get good quality. Most printers are limited to about 40mm/s or less on complex perimeters, despite being able to run perhaps 80-120mm/s on low-complexity infill before hitting other speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Between the command processing rate limits and motion planner shortcomings required by low power processors, print speeds must be much lower in practice than is strictly required by the physics and printer hardware. This all comes from 8bit processors. The workarounds and best practices to deal with this problem are so deeply baked into the toolchains and ecosystem that very few people realize there is even a problem. But it's a real limit that can be overcome: a high-speed processor running a more rigorous motion planner could generate higher average print speeds with &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; print quality. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, the ARM-based firmwares are only slowly moving towards more advanced motion planners. This is a big development area right now that is actually driving an upcoming shift away from low-end ARMs like the Cortex M3 towards even faster processors. It's actually not all that hard to max out an 84 MHz Arduino Due by piling on a bunch of firmware features. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The use of 8bit processors also makes printers LOUDER. The biggest consumer of processor time in a typical 8bit printer is the stepper interrupt that fires the step pulses to make the motors move. It is quite typical for &gt;60% of all clock cycles on an Atmega AVR to go to firing step pulses. Because this occurs as an interrupt, other processing tasks that the printer must perform -- like acceleration calculations and heater control -- get squeezed into the brief spaces between stepper interrupt events. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without careful firmware design, the step pulses will completely &quot;crowd out&quot; other functionality like LCD display updates and acceleration calculations. In order to allow higher motion rates without using all the processor resources, 8bit firmwares have a mode called &quot;step doubling&quot; that fires two (or four, or eight) step pulses per stepper interrupt so that half (or a quarter, or an eighth) as many stepper interrupts can be used to produce the same motion speed. This practice de-bottlenecks the processor, but it causes rougher and louder motor motion because the step pulses are fired in bursts rather than a constant frequency. In effect, the microstepping level of the motor is functionally dropped to a coarser mode when the stepper interrupt fires double or quad steps. So the motors get louder, less precise, and in extreme cases may have problems with resonance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An interesting side effect is that if you switch a Marlin-based printer from 1/16 microstepping to 1/32 microstepping, and keep the same print speeds, the firmware will simply start step-doubling, dropping your effective microstepping level right back down to 1/16.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ARM-based firmwares also use step doubling, but the allowable step rates are typically ~8 times higher before double/quad stepping is used. That can mean higher speeds and/or smoother motion. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another issue with 8bit AVRs is the lack of hardware floating point and need to spend many clock cycles on high-precision calculations or handling very large numbers. Delta kinematics, auto-leveling functions, calculating moves with extremely high step counts for large printers, and other advanced functionality all take a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of clock cycles on an 8bit processor. Poor firmware design or carelessly adding a feature that requires a few extra square roots and trig functions can completely bog down the processor. This kind of feature creep and code bloat has seriously impacted Marlin's performance over time as people ask more and more of the old AVR. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, a 32bit processor doesn't just have a faster clock and more clock cycles, it is also able to do much more complex math in fewer clock cycles, because it has dedicated hardware functionality that takes care of many of the steps an 8bit processor must do in software. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do 8bit processors work? Sure, they work surprisingly well for what they are and what we ask of them. But they unquestionably limit the performance and features of modern 3D printers. Even today's current generation of 32bit processors is already being maxed out by high speed printers and math-heavy features. The 8bit processor is already two generations behind what would qualify as a &quot;modern&quot; 3D printer controller. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-02-10T23:18:08.370" CommentCount="5" />

Printing at a lower layer height can dramatically increase the smoothness of the finished part, while equally increasing the printing time - among several other things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A minimum layer height of 0.1 mm is fairly common for low-cost desktop FDM printers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Nozzle diameter:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just like the layer height defines the vertical resolution of a print, the nozzle diameter defines the sharpness of horizontal features of a print. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When printing with a large nozzle diameter, all sharp edges and corners of the model will have a slight roundness to them: the larger the nozzle diameter, the more rounded sharp corners will be, and vice versa.

Most RepRap style 3d printers use thermistors. So you would need to replace the extruder temp sensors, or choose a new controller with thermocouple support. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Makerbots use 24v heaters and fans and PSUs. Most RepRap style 3d printers run on 12v (although this is slowly changing because 24v is better for performance and safety.) You can either pick a new controller that is known to be compatible with 24v, or replace all 24v-rated components with equivalent 12v-rated components. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The existing heatbed thermistor circuit is probably not the same kind of circuit that your new controller will expect. Older Makerbots use a small voltage divider circuit on the HBP PCB to convert the thermistor resistance to a voltage signal, whereas RepRap style controllers typically have this circuit on the mainboard and thus need only a simple thermistor hookup. You could add a new thermistor, or modify the existing circuit, or get an entirely new heatbed. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The existing endstops are full +5v,GND,Signal style mechanical switches with debounce capacitors and LED indicators. These &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be compatible with &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; controller boards given proper firmware setting, but you may need to do some creative wiring if there isn't a suitable three-pin endstop port on your chosen board.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The LCD and 5-button panel will not work with other boards. You'll need to replace that or just run a remote host via USB.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Connectors may be different, of course. That's always an issue with any board swap. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will need to export RepRap style gcode instead of .x3g files. Makerware/Desktop can export gcode but there may be some minor differences in Mcode assignments from what most RepRap style firmware will expect. I couldn't tell you offhand whether this will work, but to be safe, it would probably be best to use a more traditional RepRap slicer (Slic3r, Cura) or Simplify3D.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So that's a healthy to-do list. At a certain point you're practically building a new printer. &lt;strong&gt;But there is a significantly easier approach&lt;/strong&gt; than installing a RepRap style controller: replace the dead Makerbot Mightyboard with a compatible community-designed Sailfish board like the Azteeg x3 by Panucatt or new CloneBoard Mini by Carl Raffle. Or, if you're ok with Chinese sourcing, a FlashForge Mightyboard will be a near 100% drop-fit replacement for your Makerbot Mightyboard. Any of these options will give you fresh new electronics with minimal hardware changes in the rest of the printer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either way is fine and you'll end up with a working printer. Using another Sailfish board will certainly be easier, if you don't object to staying within the Sailfish/x3g toolchain and Makerbot/Clone parts ecosystem. Makerbot does have a very bad community reputation these days, but it's important to remember that the Replicator 1 Dual is a completely open-source machine from the &quot;pre-evil&quot; days, and compatible spare parts are widely available from literally dozens of vendors. The Rep1-derived Makerbots and Clones collectively comprise the most popular single &quot;flavor&quot; of 3d printer in the world (totaling as much as perhaps a quarter of all consumer/hobbyist 3d printers sold to date) and many/most of the spare parts for Replicator 2/2x's and clones will also fit in a genuine Rep1. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-02-16T22:49:17.853" CommentCount="9" />

I have heard from a number of resellers that the problems are fixed. Unfortunately, both of those are somewhat biased sources. It's surprisingly hard to get good info on the subject -- very few credible people are talking about recent experiences with the product line. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #1:&lt;/strong&gt; The main surviving user forum (&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/makerbot-users&quot;&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/makerbot-users&lt;/a&gt;) has had the torrent of people reporting 5th gen issues more or less dry up. There ARE still people posting issues, but at a fairly low level that is not far outside what you would expect for an average hobbyist printer. What we DON'T know is whether the flood of complaints has slowed because they're working better, or because very few people are actually buying them any more. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #2:&lt;/strong&gt; The power-users and community leaders that typically evaluate and review 3d printers are all avoiding the 5th gen line like the plague. Makerbot burned up a lot of community good-will by going closed source with the Replicator 2, and lost more good-will through a series of misunderstandings over patent applications and the Thingiverse terms of service (Takerbot scandals), and put the nail in the coffin by &lt;strong&gt;knowingly&lt;/strong&gt; releasing a non-functional 5th gen product line. Very few credible people are willing to give them a chance at this point, so there is a severe shortage of unbiased reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #3:&lt;/strong&gt; Makerbot has a proven history of buying off journalists and reviewers to get positive 5th gen press. Some verifiable examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hundreds of fake 5-star Amazon reviews from paid review accounts. A relevant analysis: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JI8LRRXZYNX1/&quot;&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JI8LRRXZYNX1/&lt;/a&gt; (Not verified, but related: a widely-believed rumor states that the German Amazon site actually wiped all of Makerbot's 5th Gen reviews because of blatant tampering: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/MakerBot-MP05825-Replicator-5th-H%C3%B6he/dp/B0183TP806/&quot;&gt;http://www.amazon.de/MakerBot-MP05825-Replicator-5th-H%C3%B6he/dp/B0183TP806/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The CES awards initially given to the 5th Gen line were given before Makerbot had functional firmware. None of the 5th Gens at the CES launch were functional. All demo prints shown were made on Replicator 2s. How could a non-functional product win awards? Not hard to figure that one out. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Historical positive press in the 3DP journalism media (3ders, Make Magazine, etc) has been directly proportional to the volume of ad-buys from Makerbot or the parent company Stratasys. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could keep going, but you get the idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it's hard to evaluate the reality of the situation. &lt;strong&gt;But even IF the Smart Extruder issues are truly all fixed&lt;/strong&gt; (jams, leveling issues, thermocouple connection, filament encoder failures, etc), &lt;strong&gt;there are still meaningful problems with the product line.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The print quality is not impressive. The motion mechanics, which have not been appreciably changed to my knowledge, are not great. The Smart Extruder is basically a giant pendulum wobbling off the side of a non-optimal gantry selection of an H-bot architecture. Makerbot has addressed the floppy construction via firmware tweaks to significantly slow down the machine to give marginally-acceptable print quality. According to most reports I have seen, a Replicator 5th Gen will print significantly slower than a Replicator 2, for example. Expect in the neighborhood of perhaps 30-40% longer print times than comparable printers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The price tag is roughly double or even triple the current market price for the size and print quality output of the machine. There are so many great printers on the market now for significantly less money that it's kind of nuts to drop the cash on a Makerbot.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is marketed as a PLA-only machine. That's fine if you're printing art and trinkets, but it's not a great option for mechanical parts. While you CAN print other materials, this is not technically supported. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The support plan structure has quite frankly become abusive. Makerbot used to have really helpful phone tech support, but the crushingly massive volume of 5th gen troubleshooting requests forced them into a paid tech support model. Around the same time, Makerbot shut down their user community forum and deleted links to external technical resources off their website. So unless you know the right places to go, support is scarce. For official tech support you must buy &quot;Makercare&quot; or pay for each help ticket. This is completely out of line with industry norms for a hobbyist/consumer 3d printer. They essentially took their biggest liability -- unreliable printers -- and tried to twist it into a profit center. I personally think this is a significant reason to avoid the company entirely.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to get good results from a Replicator 5th Gen? Sure. But it's a poor value for the cost, from a company that has spent the last few years systematically driving away its former loyal user base. I would recommend staying away until there's some significant change in the product line at minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-02-18T03:45:43.047" CommentCount="2" />

This plunger used copper washers to help adjust the tension required. Many people ended up upgrading their assemblies to the spring loaded mechanism as the plunger would either put too much or too little tension against the drive gear. Too little and the filament will not be driven into the hotend. Too much and the filament will grind against the drive gear and the drive gear may begin to &quot;eat&quot; away at the filament (especially when the filament becomes hotter). Obviously, if the drive gear is no longer able to catch on the filament, the nozzle will get clogged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, even with a spring mechanism, your tension can become too high. Most of these mechanisms allow you to adjust the tension by tightening/loosening the screw holding down the spring. The &quot;sweet spot&quot; for me is just past when the filament can be successfully driven into the hotend. You can test this if you have control over your extrusion motor by removing the extrusion motor from its mount, leaving the spring mechanism installed on the face of the motor. Then, turn your motor on and try feeding the filament through the mechanism. Starting with no tension on the spring, begin slowly increasing tension by tightening the screw on your mechanism until the drive gear is successfully able to guide the filament through. I might even complete another half turn on the screw to account for varying diameters and plasticity states of the filament as it becomes hot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps and please keep us updated on anything else you find.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2016-02-21T00:46:09.740" CommentCount="1" />

Additional firmware parameters clutter up my (beginner's) brain even more (and I haven't had a too deep dive into that yet).&#xA;In general I understand that the frequency we use to send the steps to the stepper is the main determining factor, also 'reduced' by microstepping, if applied. We cannot keep the current up as much as needed due to timing/inductive/electronic properties of the motors, so we lose torque or finally steps. A higher voltage helps to bring the current up faster, so the steepness of the current increase can also limit the maximum applicable frequency. The frequency itself is given from the controller board to the motor driver, hence is set in firmware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, apart from what makes sense to utilize in a 3D printer setup, what are the determining factors of the stepper speeds that can be realized and how to they transform into real life values for our printers?

There is a significant range, particularly when 32bit firmwares and RTOS-based platforms like MachineKit are compared to 8bit firmwares running on Atmega AVRs. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Marlin on a 16 MHz 8bit Atmega can only run the stepper interrupt at 10,000 hz without bogging down the processor and blocking other critical algorithms (like motion planning). It can fire step rates up to 40,000 hz by pulsing the step line two or four times per interrupt, which effectively drops the microstep level in software and runs the motors rougher/louder. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Repetier on the same Atmega can run the stepper interrupt at 12,000 hz, because it is optimized more for execution speed than Marlin.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Repetier on an 84 MHz 32bit ARM Cortex-M3 can run the stepper interrupt at 80,000 Hz.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These limits typically only affect actual stepper speed when relatively fine microstepping is used.&lt;/em&gt; Consider an example based on a very typical Marlin printer configuration. Microstepping of at least 1/4 is strongly recommended to avoid resonance issues, so let's start with 1/16 stepping. This allows quad-stepping to effectively output 1/4-steps. Starting with finer microstepping will drop our top speed, and coarser microstepping will be louder and may encounter resonance, so this is a good starting point. Then asssume a typical 32mm-per-rev pulley on a 1.8 degree (200 steps/rev) stepper motor. This system has a resolution of 200*16/32= 100 steps/mm. At 40,000 Hz total stepping rate (quad-stepping at 10,000 Hz) we can theoretically travel at 400 mm/s before hitting Marlin's hard cap. That's probably going to be a higher RPM than we want to run the motor anyway, so it's not a very impactful limit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, if we started at 1/128 stepping (such as with the THB6128 driver chip) our top speed with 8bit Marlin would be 50 mm/s. That's quite slow. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firmware motion planners&lt;/strong&gt; can further limits motor speed by ramping up and down to traverse turns and corners. If the model geometry has lots of sharp turns, the target speeds commanded by the gcode are likely to never actually be reached. Only long, straight line paths will have enough ramping time to hit the speed target. You can see this yourself by printing a very small model at a variety of feedrates and timing the actual print duration: at a certain point, increases in the commanded speed will make no difference on actual print times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another constraint some firmwares enforce is requiring the ability to safely decelerate to a stop within the length of all the motion commands in the planner queue. This allows the printer to gracefully handle a sudden loss of input, such as as if the host computer stops transmitting USB commands, or if the SD card experiences a series of read errors. If the printer just abruptly stops from full speed when it runs out of commands, it is likely to lose position and ruin the print. Whereas if it can decelerate to a safe stopping speed, it may be able to resume after the command stream resumes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of actual motor behavior, the &lt;strong&gt;inductance and back-EMF&lt;/strong&gt; introduce significant limits because they decrease motor torque at higher RPMs. This produces a torque/RPM curve that drops off at higher speeds:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHxwY.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHxwY.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note in the picture that there is a flat &quot;constant current&quot; region on the left side at low speeds. This is the range where the chopping driver is limiting coil current. On the right side of the curve, current is not able to reach the target before it must be switched back off for the next step. That reduces field strength and thus torque.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two separate effects to consider here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Motor coils are inductors, which means there is a first-order lag between applied voltage and coil current. A standard bipolar stepper motor with a microstepping driver must raise the coil current from zero to max or from max to zero every full step (eg every sixteen 1/16th microsteps). At high step rates, there is not enough time to fully charge the coil to its max current before the next step requires dropping the current back down. Without developing full coil current on each step, torque is lost. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every motor is also a generator, and spinning the rotor generates back-EMF voltage within the motor coils. That voltage waveform gets overlaid on top of the drive voltage waveform with a phase shift dependent on the rotor position relative to the coil energization position. &lt;em&gt;In simple terms, this voltage attempts to brake the motor:&lt;/em&gt; it always does whatever will slow the motor down. This means it opposes the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying forward torque, or assists the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying brake torque. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a practical discussion of speed limits, we can simplify the situation by assuming back-EMF voltage opposes the drive voltage applied to the coils. This means there is less effective voltage raising/lowering coil current, and it takes longer for the current to change, and less coil current is developed than would be the case without back-emf. This further depresses the torque/RPM curve of the motor. And when the back-EMF voltage is around the same magnitude as the drive voltage, significant motor instability can result because of complex feedback effects between rotor position and effective coil voltage. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can play with these effects using different motor configurations and speeds for a few popular 3D printer stepper drivers using my stepper driver simulator: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In closed-loop applications with position feedback and high-end drivers that can damp various instability modes, it may be ok to run the stepper all the way down the torque curve at very high RPMs. In more typical open-loop 3D printer applications, it's generally best to stick to the low-RPM part of the torque curve before inductance and back-EMF really take over the motor behavior. Losing too much torque can easily mean skipping steps and losing position, ruining the print. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another important effect for steppers is &lt;strong&gt;mid-band resonance&lt;/strong&gt;. This is not a normal mechanical resonance, but actually an electromechanical resonance effect. It's quite complicated, but the short explanation is that a stepper has an intrinsic 90-degree phase shift between position and torque, and when speeds rise to a point where coil inductance introduces an additional 90-degree phase shift between coil current and applied voltage, the electromechanical system has a highly-unstable 180-degree phase lag and thus creates a negative feedback loop. This can rapidly drop motor torque until the motor loses synchronicity with the driver's applied voltage and stalls.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mid-band resonance only occurs when coil current is limited by inductance. It cannot occur in the constant-current drive range because there is not enough phase lag between applied voltage and coil current.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZO8nN.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZO8nN.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, measured torque curves available from manufacturers almost never show resonance zones, because the curves are produced by loading motors with friction-brakes that damp any kind of resonance effect from building. Whereas a 3D printer drivetrain load is almost entirely inertial (accelerating a mass) which is much more prone to resonance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High-end drivers can automatically detect and damp mid-band resonance, but typical low-cost 3D printer drivers do not have this capability. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is generally prudent to avoid entering an RPM range where mid-band resonance may occur. This is easily accomplished by sticking to the left side of the torque curve, in the constant-current operating region. This ensures high torque and good stability. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a concrete example, consider the popular Kysan 1124090 stepper with a 24v power supply. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/SUFIv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/SUFIv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ultimachine.com/content/kysan-1124090-nema-17-stepper-motor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://ultimachine.com/content/kysan-1124090-nema-17-stepper-motor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To maintain high torque and avoid mid-band resonance, we would want to keep the RPM to about 400 or less. For the same 32mm-per-rev pulley mentioned above, that would limit speeds to around 200-240 mm/s. Higher speeds are possible, but may encounter reliability issues. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This speed, of course, assumes a 24v PSU is used, to match the measured torque curve: a 12v PSU would have a significantly lower top speed before inductance starts to limit coil current, around half as fast. Higher supply voltage &lt;em&gt;greatly&lt;/em&gt; increases the top effective speed for the motor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, you can easily simulate this effect (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim&lt;/a&gt;). This simulator output chart shows how inductance and back-EMF are keeping coil current from reaching the target:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/GYMc7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/GYMc7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For practical drivetrain design, a motor/driver simulator is really the best tool in the toolbox for finding the point where performance will start to degrade due to inability to hit current targets. It's simply too complex to apply simple equations or rules of thumb with any accuracy. These electrical effects and the firmware step generation limits are likely to be the two main restrictions on motor speed for most printers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, how fast you can melt plastic will tend to limit printing speeds significantly below the true motor speed limits, but that's a different discussion. For the moment, we can simply say that top motor speed tends to be unimportant for print moves in typical Cartesian printers. However, there are a few instances where they are likely to drive printer performance:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Linear Deltas, where carriages may need to run several times faster than the effector for certain move directions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Geared extruders with high reduction ratio (eg much over 5:1) for high retraction speeds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Short-pitch lead screws (or all-thread) that need high rotation speeds to achieve moderate linear speeds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastEditorUserId="298" LastEditDate="2016-06-10T23:02:49.323" LastActivityDate="2016-06-10T23:02:49.323" CommentCount="0" />

I'm not familiar with the inner workings of how it works, but the general advice is to be conscious of what you're working with. A heat-induced vapor treatment seems to yield the best surface finish, but can be tricky to track down proper exposure times. It seems that the time required to achieve a desirable surface finish depends on the size and openness of the features on the object. By openness, I mean how evenly the vapor is able attach itself to the surface of the object as compared to other features. Some this variability may be reduced by streamlining the process. Perhaps if you found a way to rotate either the part or the vapor container during the process. This could ensure contact is made in small corners/features. Other variables to consider may be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If a gradual reduction of exposure is necessary (as is with most heat treatment operations)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How much temperature effects time. Most pages I've read mention 100C as the temp to vaporize the chemical.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Size of the &quot;vaporization chamber&quot; in accordance with how much of the chemical is available. I've used a gallon paint can lined with lightly dabbed paper towel with Acetone for part between 1&quot;^3 to about 4&quot;^3&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's all I can think of, currently, that could potentially have the most impact on the process. Just as with 3D printing, there's not an easy way to definitively know how your parts will turn out. The sheer difference in the shape of your parts could throw out any &quot;proven process&quot; you come up with. Hopefully this gives you an idea of what things to look out for in starting out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's information about safety, before OP added disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;s&gt;As with any chemical, &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; refer to the MSDS &lt;sup&gt;(Material Safety Data Sheet)&lt;/sup&gt;!

If they don't have one, don't use the product and don't purchase from them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, you can get away with finding any MSDS online, but I'd recommend trying to get one directly from your supplier as they might theoretically have a different &quot;strand&quot; of the chemical. Therefore, reactions and safety precautions may be different than what you will find online.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A quick search yields &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/25ej7d/does_anyone_have_experience_with_pla_thf_vapor/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this MSDS&lt;/a&gt; which states that chloroform does have &quot;carcinogenic effects&quot; along with some other long-term, undesirable effects.

(How THAT is done is a different question.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The net effect is that the printer will move through a series of small &quot;linear&quot; carriage movements (linear meaning constant* speed with respect to time) that collectively approximate the necessary curved (quadratic position with respect to time) carriage motions required to produce a straight-line end-effector move.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*(&lt;em&gt;Constant speed before acceleration slowdowns are applied in order to obey dynamics constraints, anyway. Again, that's the subject of a different question.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Segmentation is very similar to the process of using a polygon to approximate a circle. If the facets are small enough, the polygon is a good approximation. Higher Segmentation rates produce less path-following error.  The primary conceptual difference between drawing circle arcs and Delta motion paths is that the so-called &quot;faceted arc&quot; with Delta Segmentation is constructed in height-vs-time coordinates instead of the X-vs-Y coordinates you'd use to draw a circle on a computer screen. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This system is used in large part because support for Delta style printers was originally bolted onto GRBL-based motion planners which were written exclusively for straight-line motion paths in Cartesian printers. It was a relatively minimal modification to the existing codebase compared to implementing full quadratic path interpolation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Techniques have evolved over the years. And alternate approaches are often used: for example, the dc42 fork of RepRapFirmware performs exact path-following without segmentation, by recalculating the proper time for the next step &lt;em&gt;after every step&lt;/em&gt;. This is functionally equivalent to approximating a circle with a polygon facet count &lt;em&gt;so high that every pixel on the screen gets its own facet&lt;/em&gt;. So it is exactly as accurate as the positioning resolution of the motors allows. The downside is that this segmentation-free technique is fairly processor-intensive, so it only works on relatively fast controllers, not the older 8bit Atmega AVR that powers most existing consumer/hobbyist printers today. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other techniques are possible. The academic parallel robotics control literature is a whole other world of mathematical techniques and complexity in order to produce generalized control algorithms that work for a wide range of robot mechanisms. The version we use in open-source 3d printers is quite simple and application-specific in comparison. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastEditorUserId="298" LastEditDate="2016-02-25T21:10:01.643" LastActivityDate="2016-02-25T21:10:01.643" CommentCount="0" />

On MM2 the whole build platform moves along Y -- on my printer it weighs far more than on a regular-size MM2 -- it's 6 times the mass just because of size, besides that it has to be much stiffer to avoid sagging over that distance. I went to a larger motor, but it could still barely move the axis.

If you want to do high-speed printing or use any of the fancier features, you should go with 32bit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big issue with 8bit comes up when you want to do something that taxes the MCU. Delta kinematics already add a lot of extra math on top of all the normal printer functions like command parsing, motion planning, and heater control. For example, adding any of these to an 8bit Delta can cause issues:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bed tilt compensation &quot;auto-leveling&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; -- the coordinate space rotation transform adds a lot of extra floating point calculations to every movement segment. That really taxes the 8bit Atmega since it does not have native floating point support. (Note that pre-print auto-calibration such as in the RichCattell Marlin fork is not the same as bed tilt compensation and does not add any run-time processor load.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full graphics LCDs&lt;/strong&gt; -- refreshing the LCD screen for animations and status reports takes a surprising amount of horsepower. 8bit Marlin is widely known to suffer from stuttering and print quality issues when running a GLCD on a delta.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highly faceted (smooth) curves, particularly over USB&lt;/strong&gt; -- the high rate of gcode command processing sucks up a lot of clock cycles, particularly in firmwares that run USB comms as a top-priority interrupt. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What the Due (or other 32bit board option) does for you is de-bottleneck the MCU so you can push the printer harder or utilize features that add processor load. Here's why they're so much better:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In simple clock speed terms, the SAM3X8E in the Due/Duet/Alligator/etc is about 5 times faster than the Atmega 2560, and the LPC1769 in the Smoothieboard/MKS-SBASE/etc is about 7 times faster. But they're actually MUCH higher performance than clock speed alone would suggest, because the 32bit architecture and native floating point support mean far fewer clock cycles are required for complex calculations. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They also have more RAM, meaning the the firmware can manage more features and look farther ahead when motion planning. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They also have more program space, meaning the firmware can, if desired, be compiled as a single full-featured build that covers all possible printers (as RepRapFirmware and Smoothieware do) and thus end-users don't have to edit and compile code in the Arduino IDE to configure the firmware. The Atmega line requires hundreds of conditional compile statements in the firmware to exclude unused features from the binary to get the memory footprint down.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that said, the switch from an 8bit Atmega AVR to a 32bit ARM Cortex-M3 is still just an upgrade from a late-1990s processor to an early-2000s processor. Neither is &quot;modern&quot; by any stretch. &lt;em&gt;(For example, the BeagleBone Black used by Redeem and MachineKit utterly blows away the Due in processing power and memory. But those options have steep learning curves at the moment.)&lt;/em&gt; The Due can still be bogged down by printing very fast with lots of features enabled. It's a &lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt; upgrade on an Atmega, but I predict it's going to be replaced by much faster controllers within the next few years. Announcements of upcoming next-gen controller boards are already trickling out. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To summarize, the answer is yes, a Due-type board is a good buy if you want a high-performance printer. It will meet 99%+ of user's needs today.&lt;/strong&gt; But it will be replaced in a few years, just like the Atmegas are being replaced now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As for specific Due shields, I strongly recommend NOT going with RAMPS-FD.&lt;/strong&gt; It was cloned for sale by Asian companies before the design was finished, which seemingly caused the original designer to abandon it before working out all the bugs. RAMPS-FDv1 has some nasty design flaws such as heaters turning on while flashing firmware. RAMPS-FDv2 is better, but can experience unreliable and oddball behavior due to unresolved issues in the circuits intended to make it compatible with both 3v3 boards like the Due and 5v boards like the Mega. (For example, the thermistor voltage reference circuit needs modifying to work right, and there appears to be timing issues in the 3v3-5v level shifters.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RADDS is a good Due shield.&lt;/strong&gt; It is a simpler, more reliable, more compact version of RAMPS-FD. It is very popular in Germany and has recently (late 2015) become available for sale in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also recommend purchasing the Due R3-E instead of the regular Due R3. Anecdotally, the &quot;E&quot; version appears to eliminate some firmware bootup issues that can occur when the board is first powered at lower than nominal voltage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One possible downside to the Due is that Arduino just announced they are no longer manufacturing it. So all new Due boards from here on will be made by 3rd parties. That's not necessarily bad, since it's open source and many other companies will surely continue making them, but there won't be any more made by Arduino. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For single-board options using the same SAM3X8E processor as the Due, the Duet 0.8.5 is becoming quite popular. (It runs RepRapFirmware, which has some great Delta features.) The Alligator runs Repetier. There are several other beta/experimental/development boards in the works too.

Specifically, the filament path between the drive gear or hob and hot end must be extremely well-constrained. 1.75mm TPE filaments (thermoplastic elastomers) will buckle in an instant if given the chance. That means they will try to squeeze out of any little opening in the filament drive path rather than being forced through the nozzle. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is there a gap &gt;1mm &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; between your extruder drive gear and hot end? &lt;em&gt;Including the groove in the drive gear itself.&lt;/em&gt; If so, either change extruders or print something to fill the gap. Many popular extruders already have Ninjaflex conversion parts uploaded on Thingiverse or Youmagine.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are you using a 1.75mm bowden drive? You probably shouldn't bother with the softer TPEs like Ninaflex. Harder TPEs like Semiflex may be ok, but it's still difficult. 3mm bowden drives may perform ok. Direct drive extruders are highly recommend. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;TPUs (thermoplastic urethanes) in particular can be sticky in the filament feed path between the spool and extruder. Try to minimize corners and turns (even inside PTFE tubes) between the extruder and spool. As a general rule of thumb, don't exceed 180 degrees of cumulative tube curvature in the entire path from the spool to the nozzle. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once your filament feed path is fully enclosed, the filament will be constrained and unable to squeeze out the side or wrap around your drive gear. That's the most important step.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next problem is simply &lt;strong&gt;loading&lt;/strong&gt; the filament. Purging out PLA or ABS with a soft TPE can be challenging because of the force required to purge the old material. Many default loading routines are actually too fast for TPEs and will cause the TPE filament to bunch up rather than purging the previous material. It tends to extrude better when there is nothing else in the way. Some tips:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do some cold-pulls to clear out the hot end as much as possible before loading the TPE. (Nylon is ideal for this. Preheat to nylon temps, run through some nylon, let the extruder cool to ~180C, and then forcefully pull out the nylon. If you can't pull it out, pull hotter. If it leaves nylon behind, pull colder.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you have a high-melting plastic like PET or nylon in the hot end, purge with a lower-melting solid filament like PLA first. This will reduce the viscosity of the old material when inserting the TPE. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your printer has a fixed loading speed, consider making a gcode file with nothing but a preheat and very slow extruder move as a custom loading script. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you fail to load and jam up the TPE, try again! Sometimes it takes a few load/unload cycles to get the old material purged and a clean feed going. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final issue is &lt;strong&gt;print settings&lt;/strong&gt;. You ever hear the saying, &quot;you can't push a rope&quot;? That's kind of what you're fighting with TPEs. With a properly constrained feed path, you can push rubber, but not very hard. So minimizing extrusion force is the name of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Print SLOW to start. Like 10mm/s. You can dial it up once you're getting good results. This will minimize nozzle back-pressure and reduce the amount of &quot;pushing a rope&quot; that the extruder drive must do.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Retract as little as possible. Turn off &quot;optional&quot; retractions in your slicer, such as during layer changes. Some people even print with no retraction at all, and use high travel speeds and coast/wipe features to minimize stringing. That's overkill, but it can help with marginal extruders. I personally add about 50% to my normal ABS/PLA retraction distance. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Print on the hotter side of the recommended range to start, then dial down the temp as needed to reduce stringing and oozing. Printing hot will reduce nozzle back-pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With all that, it should be possible to print the softest TPEs with reasonable success. But if you really can't get it working right, plenty of higher-durometer TPEs are available now that are significantly easier to extrude. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-02-29T04:09:53.643" CommentCount="1" />

Preheat, load, unload, level bed, etc are all done via the LCD and seamlessly built-in scripts. There is no need to connect host software to do anything but update firmware and change rarely-adjusted settings like acceleration parameters. RepRap-style USB control of Sailfish printers is perfectly functional, but not really necessary 99.9% of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a major reason why Sailfish printers have historically been popular for printer farms. They're designed for stand-alone operation, which is highly favorable when the printers greatly outnumber the associated computers. It's extremely rare to see a Sailfish printer from the last 5 years without a 5-button LCD panel. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sailfish firmware UI/UX is simply built around the LCD buttons rather than host software. This is &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; more reliable and higher-performance than, say, Marlin via host because it reduces processor time spent on command transmission and eliminates all the possible failure modes in the PC and USB link. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming all Sailfish printers will have LCDs with SD card support and focusing on that one interface really allowed the creation of an overall better printer. More optimization, fewer things that need to be configured by the end-user. But in exchange, you're limited in what kind of hardware Sailfish will support. It's a tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, LCD support was more strapped onto RepRaps as an option rather than the core interface element. This tends to produce a host-driven interface design, rather than an LCD-driven interface design.

PLA that is too hot will smell of pancakes/waffles much stronger than normal, or even smell burnt. The printed material may be more shiny than usual.

The external TC should read within a few degrees of the printer's TC.

This is because small details make the filament stay inside the nozzle longer, which the heat eventually make the filament swole up and block the path. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To find out if your problem is cause by &quot;heat creep&quot; or not, try to print something small but tall and print something large overall.

If both print ( small and big ) take the same amount of time to clog your nozzle, then it may not cause by &quot;heat creep&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SO HERE the solution for &quot;heat creep.&quot; First and the most important, replace your thermal barrier tube. Second, lower the temperature. Third, check the filament guide components such as the drive gear, bearing, and spring. For example, check the drive gear if it securely screw into the stepper motor.

Regarding your questions: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does lowering the temperature help? Raising it?&lt;/strong&gt; : Yes, lowering the temperature can help. I've found that it is best to stay closer to the lower end of the material's melting point and just a bit above the point. Not only does this help with potential over extrusion, but also shortens the time it takes for the material to cool (refer to the link above). &lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, this could cause clogging if your temperature is too low. Keep an eye on your drive gear to see if there is too much friction while at lower temperatures. Increasing may keep the drive gear from &quot;eating&quot; your filament.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does speeding up or slowing down the print head help?&lt;/strong&gt; : I prefer to print slower, most of the time, to allow the material to cool a bit more to avoid curling/warping (I primarily print with ABS, so it matters more). You might be able to give and take between temperature and speed. Consider if your nozzle is cooler and your speed is up, bridging gaps might yield the same results as if you proportionately swap these two values. This concept may only matter if you are in a pinch to get the part done. Again, I prefer slowing my machine down as it allows current/previous layers to cool more before continuing. This can be especially helpful with overhangs when paired with lowering your nozzle temperature.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does increasing/decreasing the extrusion diameter, or layer height help&lt;/strong&gt; - I assume that extrusion diameter equals layer height (not difference in nozzle diameter, aka swapping nozzles). I'm not completely sure, but I think this depends on the part as well as slicing engine settings. For me, MakerWare is pretty good about proportionately adjusting extrusion steps with layer height, so I see an equal change in the width of the extrusion. I would think that in general, a larger layer height would yield a larger extrusion width. This would be helpful when printing overhangs, but may not be helpful when printing bridges (a larger strand will retain heat longer than a smaller one).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps, please comment if you need more information/clarification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2016-03-04T17:49:13.747" LastActivityDate="2016-03-04T17:49:13.747" CommentCount="4" />

You need the plastic to solidify before it has a chance to sag. PLA in particular has to shed a lot of heat before it is fully solid. A fan and air guide setup using a &quot;squirrel-cage&quot; radial blower around the nozzle is optimal. A little 30mm or 40mm axial fan will not provide optimal performance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Low layer height when slicing is less obvious, but is extremely effective. When you use thinner layers, two things happen:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is less melted plastic per pass and a higher surface area to volume ratio, so the fresh material cools faster. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A larger percentage of each strand in the overhang is supported by the previous strand. If you do 0.2mm thick by 0.4mm wide, half of each strand is unsupported. But if you do 0.1mm thick by 0.4mm wide, only a quarter of each strand is unsupported. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you combine these two effects, it is possible to exceed 70 degree overhangs with good surface quality. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another lesser factor is printing shells/perimeters inside-out rather than outside-in.

The decrease is about 0.6A each for the XYAB steppers and 1.7A each for two hot ends, totalling 5-6A of avoided peak power draw. (Even lower if you preheat with the steppers disabled rather than idling.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The history here is that one of Makerbot's design decisions with the Replicator 2 and 2x was to utilize off-the-shelf UL-listed power bricks (like a laptop might use) instead of an internal power supply. This made engineering and safety certification much easier, and completely eliminated mains-voltage wiring inside the printer, which is a big safety plus. However, the largest readily-available 24v power brick had slightly less current capacity than optimal. So Makerbot came up with a software workaround for the hardware limitation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want, you can replace the stock power brick with a ~350w PSU and preheat everything at once.

For a device like a 3D printer, I don't like the idea that of my axes can accumulate up to ±0.16 in. of error over 100 pitches (the pitch is between 0.12 in. and 0.25 in. so that is 12 to 25 in.). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrast this to a belt where the only way you have a cumulative error is if you skip a tooth and I think the winner is the GT2.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the non-cumulative pitch error both products are comparable but again the belt wins. For the Synchromesh we have an accuracy of ±0.002 in. versus ±0.0003(1) in. for a 2 mm GT2 belt and ±0.0012(1) in. for a 3 mm GT2 belt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I can't be certain about exact values for error since there are no numbers for the GT2 - only a stupid chart.

The two-rod-plus-screw arrangement is quite over-constrained and thus requires good alignment to move smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some basic troubleshooting steps:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make sure the screw is not constrained at both ends. It is very difficult to manufacture a screw that is perfectly straight and then mount it so precisely that it can rotate with zero runout. Screws in light-duty linear motion applications should be allowed to &quot;wobble&quot; freely so any bend or runout doesn't apply side-load forces to the Z stage. This can be accomplished by putting a misalignment-tolerant coupler (like an Oldham coupler) on the driven end, and/or leaving the non-driven end free without any support bearing. A motor mount with a small amount of compliance (like a rubber stepper damper) can help when the screw is captive to the motor. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lubricate the screw and bearings and make sure everything is clean and in good condition. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Allow the Z carriage to self-align the rods and screw. The proper technique for this will depend on the Z stage, but the basic idea is to loosen the rod and screw mounts on either end, run the Z carriage back and forth a few times to push the rods into position, and then only re-tighten the top and bottom hardware when the carriage is at that end. It may also be necessary to loosen the screw nut and bearings on the carriage to get everything aligned properly and smooth-running, but that does not enforce parallelism like loosening the rod and screw mounts, so is really a secondary step. It may be necessary to leave some &quot;float&quot; in one rod or the bearings on one rod (with gravity preloading out any resultant slop) if the hardware has major alignment issues. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the stage still binds after doing the above, it may be necessary to check if the linear hardware is bent (such as by rolling rods on a flat table) or use a file or Dremel to loosen up the mounts or whatever feature is causing the misalignment. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-03-11T20:02:00.360" CommentCount="0" />

You can use a heat gun or torch (outside!!) to tell the difference between PE and PTFE. PE will soften quickly and then melt fairly easily, whereas PTFE will simply go clear and eventually char without melting. Nylon is also sometimes used for feed tubes with acceptable results, but if you have any suspicion about the tube material, just buy new PTFE tubes from a reputable vendor like McMaster. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Too many loops/curves in the tube. Total drag friction is an exponential function of the total amount of curvature in the tube. You should have one good U-loop, no spirals or floppy zig-zags. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Excessive friction on the spool rotation. Any spool back-tension gets greatly magnified through the feed tube per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capstan_equation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;capstan equation&lt;/a&gt;. This can be caused by a bad spool holder, or if the filament is knotted on the spool due to letting the end of the spool loose during handling. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-03-16T20:23:51.700" CommentCount="0" />

Consider to use a shoe with a flat insole, perhaps even what is commonly called a flip-flop. If your objective is to perfectly match the curve of her foot bottom, this should work. Apply a layer of polymer modeling clay, plasticine or similar material. It should be warm enough to permit her foot/feet to settle in and push enough material away to remove any voids. If voids appear, one could then add a few blobs and repeat the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously some will ooze from the sides, which will have to be trimmed away. Trim a sufficient amount to fit her regular shoes and you'll have a reasonable match of the necessary fit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The resulting shape can then be scanned with a 3d scanner and converted to a 3d model. Even if the clay is excessively thick, the typical 3d model editor can slice away the excess, although one would have to make an almost arbitrary judgement for the location of the slicing plane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option comes to mind. There are various silicone molding products. I've used one from makeyourownmolds.com that is of a consistency of frosting. When mixed together and applied, it makes a perfect duplicate of the item, in reverse. Another product sold at the local HobbyLobby is a similar molding compound that is more akin to the modeling clay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both compounds will release easily from skin, are non-toxic and would provide a more durable model from which to scan. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think one difficulty you may have is how to determine the correct foot pressure and posture to achieve the desired results. The modeling clay would give you more support and probably be more accurate. If your objective is to provide the same support as a bare foot, the silicone molding method would be more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you stretch the concept even further, once you have the silicone or clay mold, you would be able to use the pin-art concept.

Try getting hold of a local service that can use a 3D Laser Scanner to get a mesh model. The same service might even be able to create solid model of the desired insole if you have dimensions of the shoe you wish to use. Next, you'll need to contact another service to 3D print the insole (most likely in nylon or similar) or, if you have a 3D printer, print the insole yourself. If you are considering printing yourself, and have not before used a material like nylon, please review the material specifications. Some suppliers recommend the use of a heated build plate with these type of materials to ensure the material properties are retained during heating/cooling.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm suggesting Laser Scanning as it will be the most economical and flexible means of reverse engineering the dimensions you're requesting.

A 3D printer extruder is very, very hot, and will easily exceed the ratings of many typical silicone glues in normal service or during a runaway event. (You should always plan for an eventual thermal runaway. They're alarmingly common with cheap kit printers.) Even high-temp glues will not survive the temperatures an extruder can reach at full power if the firmware locks up. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Muffler putty is popular for fixing thermistors because it's one of the few widely-available ways of attaching a thermistor that will easily withstand the heat. In fact, it will survive after the aluminum hot block melts. (Yes, that can happen.) But muffler putty is fairly brittle, and has a different coefficient of thermal expansion from aluminum, so there is some risk of the thermistor detaching over time. I really don't recommend puttying thermistors used in extruders -- many people do, but it's less robust and less secure for long-term use than the proper hardware fixing methods found in modern hot block designs like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://e3d-online.com/Spares/v6-Heater-Block-and-Fixings&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;E3Dv6&lt;/a&gt;.

Therefore the G-Code creates will only have straight line movements (G0, G1).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With a format that can describe curves, the slicer could end up with circles and arcs on the 2d slice and could then use G2 and G3 moves. And if the Firmware of your printer understands these commands you would get the best possible quality with rather small model files.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="204" LastActivityDate="2016-03-20T15:38:43.993" CommentCount="3" />

Cleaning the tray should be done also per manufacturer's spec, although each printer's user forum may provide better or more effective options.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Pegasus Touch has a caution regarding dripping resin on the mirrors, so there's operational care considerations for these types of printers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a build platform for these printers. The flatness and level are as critical or more so for resin printers, as the resolution can be astonishingly high. If any portion of a print does not bond to the platform, that entire print will have a failed section, creating an entirely failed print. Gravity is not particularly helpful in that respect, at least with the Pegasus Touch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The release medium varies from device to device. The Pegasus Touch originally used PDMS (silicon release compound) and now uses what's called a SuperVat. The plastic material in the SuperVat is purported to provide better release and fewer failures, along with increased lifespan. PDMS becomes cloudy from repeated printing in the same location and can be torn away from the vat if the print does not properly release.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've become aware of a product from Australia that has had good reports from use in a B9 Creator resin printer. The report indicates that it releases the model quite easily and barely turns cloudy. I have an order pending for this material, as I am hopeful it will perform as described.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mechanics are also varied. One expects a system to raise and lower the build platform and to direct the laser or illumination system (DLP), but generally, this type of printer is somewhat simpler mechanically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because I live in a hot humid climate, my Pegasus Touch remains in the box, and my brain is about to explode with what I've learned of using it. Environmental conditions are likely to vary with different machines. I've seen references that 70 degrees F is too cold, others that say 70-75 degrees F is just fine, anything higher is too hot. Another user says that 65 degrees is good. The type of resin also becomes an important factor for environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The laser will create heat in the resin, so I'm inclined to believe that cooler is better. Different colors require different durations of laser light, somewhat akin to various plastics having different temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;supports and overhangs are important considerations in an SLA or DLP printer, just as they are in FDM.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Expect also that many of the resin printers require that the user purchase only the product provided by the manufacturer. This isn't necessarily a negative as most of the resin sources are priced similarly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I've missed any part of your question, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="854" LastActivityDate="2016-03-20T20:45:34.890" CommentCount="2" />

Here are the major downsides:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Significantly more expensive to operate than FDM printers, in most cases. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The resin is seriously toxic until fully cured. Fumes can be an issue for users handling raw resin, and you should NEVER put a photopolymer print into a chemically-sensitive environment like an aquarium or children's toy. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Prints require messy post-processing to rinse off excess resin (usually with rubbing alcohol) and additional UV light exposure to finish hardening the photopolymer. The used alcohol/resin rinse mix is basically hazmat waste. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In bottom-up printers, the window in the print vat is typically a consumable. Some printers require replacing the vat ($$) after every liter or two of cured resin. (Technology is advancing rapidly here though.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The peel mechanism in bottom-up printers is often a major source of print flaws, due to the need to rock/tilt/slide the print to free it from the vat window.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In top-down printers, you have to pay a large up-front consumables cost to initially fill the resin tank. (There are workarounds here like floating a layer of resin on brine, but these have their own technical issues.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you leave the resin in the printer for an extended period, you'll probably find a hardened layer on the surface from stray light exposure and have to clean out or replace the vat.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Resin vats/tanks need to be kept clean and free of cured resin debris from failed prints or stray light. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every combination of resin chemistry, printer light source, and printer optics requires specific tuning to dial in the photopolymer curing behavior. This means it's somewhat difficult to change resin brands, and you may effectively be locked into the printer manufacturer's resin. Many light sources will change in intensity or develop dim regions over time as they age, which will either harm print quality, require period recalibration, or require frequent light source replacement. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is a limited number of options for print materials. Technology here is advancing rapidly, but for the most part, SLA/DLP prints are non-load-bearing models with a limited range of color options. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are some pretty significant &quot;user experience&quot; downsides compared to a consumer desktop FDM printer.

The electric field of the trapped electrons adds to the electrons in the floating gate, lowering the window between threshold voltages for zeros vs ones.

Although FDM is certainly a realistic &quot;no-brainer&quot; capability for this setup, I believe this level of accuracy, speed and volume - not to mention the original cost being well over $100K - justifies a finer level of output and I believe Stereolithography (SLA) is what I'd like to concentrate on.  With such a large printing surface/volume (37&quot;X x 24&quot;Y x 28&quot;Z), I don't know how I would implement a DLP projector to cover such a large surface and still maintain the level of accuracy and resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This system is already equipped with the highest quality stepper motors and a &quot;staccato&quot; high-speed driver-controller, an on-board pneumatic &amp;amp; electrical 6-channel controller that could be used for selecting colors, resin injection/flow, resin tank elevation, curing LEDs, temperature/ventilation fans, laser scanning, router speed, etc.  The X &amp;amp; Y movement guide bars are located in the upper deck, moving the Z axis component assembly.  That assembly requires simplification to enable it to be downsized to allow for the printer output to reach closer to the perimeter of the output area, but the weight &amp;amp; bulk of the assembly is greater than any DLP projector that would take its place so this system can reliably perform with a heavier projector if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, I think I'm looking for a software-defined method of coordinating the X &amp;amp; Y movement of the projector's output to the printing surface (presumable a tray of photo-sensitive SLA resin).  Since the projector's proximity to the printing surface must remain relatively close, the output will be constrained to an area significantly smaller than this platform's entire printable surface, the projector's output will have to &quot;play a movie&quot; of the model and instead of projecting still images, I believe it would require an animated output that exposes the resin to build models.  Sort of like a silk screen process but with UV light.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm slightly familiar with the concept of manipulating laser beams using micro mirror aiming devices to draw on SLA resin beds - and this is a possible solution if I knew where to find such a component and how to control it, but that kind of printing would be far too slow for making large-scale models because it would essentially almost as slow as a pen plotter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is anyone aware of an existing method of integrating the &quot;moving picture&quot; method I'm thinking of, or have I envisioned something that hasn't been invented yet?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/4P3nm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/4P3nm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sciclone-Before Conversion&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1163" LastEditorUserId="26" LastEditDate="2016-03-27T06:55:48.633" LastActivityDate="2016-03-27T06:55:48.633" Title="Is there a method or S/W available to stitch together a DLP projector's output into a &quot;moving picture&quot; to SLA print in a larger area than its output?"

The reason for the recommendation is that jams will occur with most all-metal hot ends if you pull molten filament up into the cold zone. Any molten filament that enters the cold zone rapidly cools and hardens and sticks to the walls, very often forming a jam. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the requirement is to keep your retraction distance &lt;em&gt;at the extruder&lt;/em&gt; less than 2mm.

Here are few things to note when attempting to 3D print the tetrahedral honeycomb:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't recommend trying to 3D print this with a an FDM/FFF printer as you will most likely need supports and there would not be enough strength laterally. You may be able to &lt;em&gt;print&lt;/em&gt; the design using SLA, but handling would be very difficult before post-processing as the part is very brittle post-print until a heat treat or curing process is done to chemically solidify. The post-process of the SLA could determine how strong the part is (ie. stainless steel powder, infused with bronze in a heat treat process would be good for such a part).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While SLS may be the best method for 3D printing this type of design, for that size part (30x30x10cm) you're looking at an expensive print regardless of whether or not you print it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, I would highly recommend finding (or designing your own) a joint connector that would allow you to join wood/plastic dowels in the tetrahedral honeycomb shape. Not only will this be cheaper for you in the long run (easier to replace a few broken segments than an entire 3D printed model), but it could provide more structural strength for something that could potentially get banged around, like a tricopter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:176263&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this model&lt;/a&gt; on Thingiverse (not my model) shows an example of how you can utilize 3D printing complex or custom joints that allow you to connect dowels in the shape you're looking for.

The main problem is that it's a semi-crystalline material, which means it doesn't follow the normal rules for warping prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An amorphous polymer like ABS or PET is able to slowly flow or creep until it cools below the glass point, Tg. This means the stresses caused by thermal contraction will &quot;shake out&quot; above Tg and only start accumulating when the print cools below Tg and fully solidifies. That's why heated build plates are usually set around the glass point for amorphous materials -- there's minimal warping stress in the print at that temp.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, when you extrude semi-crystalline polymers like PE or PP, crystallization starts as soon as the temp drops below the melt point, Tm. A crystalline polymer will not flow or creep at a rate that is meaningful over the duration of an FDM print, so thermal contraction stresses will simply build up more and more as the plastic is cooled farther below Tm. And there's a loooong way to go when cooling from Tm to room temp. As a result, you get HUGE warping stresses with these plastics compared to more typical FDM materials. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is simply not possible to pick a heated bed or heated chamber temp that entirely eliminates the tendency of PP to warp. The normal rules we use for amorphous polymers don't apply. And, greatly compounding the problem, PP is a very low-surface-energy material with adhesion behavior fairly similar to wax. It doesn't want to stick to much of anything except itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High warping stress + poor adhesion = bad times. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the simple answer is, polypropylene does not have the correct polymer behavior to be favorable for FDM. You will always be fighting warping. Think carefully about whether you want to struggle with PP or switch to a more suitable material that could accomplish the same design goal for the printed part. Do you really need to use PP? PET blends have similar hardness and chemical resistance, nylon blends have similar toughness, and TPUs can handle living hinge applications. That covers most of the reasons you'd want to use PP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely must use PP, you're going to need to pull out ALL the tricks people use with traditional high-warp materials like ABS and PC and nylon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use a build plate made of a close relative of the material you're printing. For example, people have successfully printed HDPE on a PP build plate, so I would imagine that a HDPE build plate should work for PP. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Or, use a perfboard build plate with a raft so the initial layer will get embedded into the holes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Or, use a coarse fibrous surface like stiff cardboard or fiberboard.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get the build chamber enclosed and as hot as you can without damaging the printer. 50C is usually reasonable for motors, extruders, etc unless you have PLA printed parts to worry about. (Heated build plates only really help with the bottom 5-10mm of the print if the printer is not enclosed.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use helper disks / mouse ears on corners.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Really mash the first layer down onto the build plate. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Print low layer heights, like 0.1mm. Smaller layers mean the thermal contraction applies more shear stress between layers, and less of the large-scale aggregate bending stress that lifts corners. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Higher print speeds may also help due to some complex strain-crystallization effects, but that's only currently proven in nylon to my knowledge. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option, if it meets your functional requirements, is to use a fiberglass or carbon fiber composite PP. CFR and GFR plastics usually warp less than virgin plastics. The fibers have a low coefficient of thermal expansion, which makes the composite material contract less as it cools, which reduces warping stress. The most successful PP printing I've ever seen was GFR-PP. But that stuff is hard to find and may not work if the part needs to be flexible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-04-06T19:03:40.017" CommentCount="1" />

You really just need to keep everything a little bit &quot;wet&quot; with oil or grease and performance will be adequate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main downside to using grease with sintered bushings is that they will likely stop being &quot;self-lubricating&quot; after the first exposure. The grease tends to clog the pores that allow the sintered bushings' factory oil impregnation to maintain a nice oil film on the sliding surfaces. So the bushings will forever-after require regular re-greasing, just like the ball bearings and threaded rod. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, a light machine oil like 3-in-one will maintain the sintered bushings' self-lubricating properties, but if used in ball bearings and screws will require very frequent replenishment.

Grease doesn't need to be applied as often, and it tends to stay where you put it rather than dripping.

It's trial and error. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The temp number your printer reports really doesn't matter. That's just a process control variable: it needs to be consistent and repeatable, but it doesn't need to be accurate against an independent reference.

There are two main speed limits for a printer: how fast the motion mechanism can move the nozzle without running into issues or unacceptable print quality degradation (which is also a function of acceleration settings), and how fast the hot end can heat up and melt filament. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mechanism speed limits you have to find via trial and error. Pick a test print you like (such as Benchy) and repeat it with different tuning until you find your preferred limits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Melt flow restrictions are slightly more complex, because they are a function of VOLUME flow rate, not commanded speeds. Make a large boxy test print (with long straight lines) and multiply extrusion width times layer height times feedrate. That will give you your approximate flow rate in mm^3/sec. Generally speaking, every extruder + hot end + material combo will have a maximum feasible flow rate. For example, most &quot;average&quot; hobbyist printers with 0.4mm nozzles and good extruders can extrude about 4-8 mm^3/sec with PLA.

This will be the main body of your 'screw'.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To make the thread, you need to create a helix primitive. You can edit the number of coils and the coil thickness in the Maya GUI.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Once you have the thread, it is a simple matter of performing a couple of boolean operations. The first boolean (union) operation will unite the screw made in step 1 with the thread made in step 2. The second boolean (subtract) operation will cut out the thread from the object within which you want your screw to be driven into. When you print the two models, you should find that the screw nicely turns into the object from which you cut out the thread.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point is: yes, it is easy to do such things in most 3D software packages. Maya comes with a nice selection of default objects you can use, so essentially you need to do no 'modeling' yourself to create something like the example you showed us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your next question, about editing models on Thingiverse. The reason why you cannot edit them easily is because most models there have been decimated and triangulated, which makes them very difficult to reshape or edit because the topology is no longer strictly manifold -- it is just a big mess of triangles! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to edit Thingiverse models, I recommend something like ZBrush. You can import triangulated models and then rebuild the geometry into quads (using DynaMesh, for example), which you can then edit to your liking. Once done, you can simply decimate and re-export as STL or whatever extension you need.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, low/high poly is not so relevant in 3D print outs, especially in mechanically functioning parts. This is because most models are created in high resolution (high polygon count) and then decimated + triangulated down to truncate file sizes. But the functionality and physical feel of the model should not change due to this process - it just takes practice and lots of experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hassan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1416" LastActivityDate="2016-04-16T02:01:12.807" CommentCount="0" />

One can then observe the output and make a subjective determination of the print quality along the length of the column, and adopt the parameter value associated with the position in Z that produced the &quot;best&quot; outcome in terms of finish, strength and layer adhesion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A standard plugin for the free slicer program &quot;Cura&quot; called &quot;TweakAtZ&quot; allows one to generate such a script, and could be a good option even if you normally would use a different slicer.

The cold zone needs to be cool for the extruder to work right. It looks like the cold zone is not staying below the glass point of the plastic, so the filament softens and mashes into a jam. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some common causes of jamming in Replicator 2 extruders:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Printer's environment is too hot. If it's in a hot garage, move it indoors. If you have it inside an enclosure or cabinet, open it up to let it breathe. All-metal extruders with PLA are very sensitive to ambient temp. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not having good contact between the heatsink and the cooling bar. Normally, just bolting them together is fine, but a small amount of of thermal grease (like Arctic Silver) smeared over the contact surface can help too.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not having the fan pointed the right way. You want the fan to blow ONTO the heatsink: this provides more turbulent flow and better cooling. This means you should not see the fan sticker when everything is assembled.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fan dying and and spinning too slow. A new fan can be a good idea. (24v fans only!) Or you can try gently peeling off the fan sticker and adding a single drop of light oil (like 3-in-one) to the bearing, then re-attaching the sticker.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Using non-stock thermal barrier tubes that do not have the correct internal geometry. Lots of people sell bad tubes that don't have the &quot;secret sauce&quot; (internal diameter step). The four good vendors I'm aware of for this part are Makerbot, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.raffle.ch/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Carl Raffle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.micro-swiss.com/#!product-page/cv9c/486618f3-3e55-0d63-e3b0-f94eb2277b58&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Micro Swiss&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.p3-d.com/collections/replacements-parts/products/thermal-barrier-tubes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Performance 3D&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Floating&quot; the thermal barrier threads by tightening jam nuts on both top and bottom of the cooling bar. All-metal extruder designs require good contact pressure between the thermal barrier tube threads and the cooling bar, to ensure maximum heat transfer. The best approach is to put one jam nut below the bar to forcibly push the thermal barrier tube threads into the cooling bar, and no nut on top. (Using just one nut on top is better than two nuts, but worse than one nut below.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also possible that there is some material partially blocking the nozzle, which is contributing to molten plastic backup up and jamming. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I would recommend right now is removing both the nozzle and thermal barrier tube from the printer, and either replacing them or fully cleaning them out. There are multiple options. You can preheat the hot end with the cooling bar in a vise or on a metal surface with no fans attached, to heat up the plastic in the thermal barrier tube and allow you to push the blockage through with a small allen key. Then do something to REALLY clean it out, like nylon cold-pulls, or cooking the parts in a blue flame such as a torch or gas stove. Then check for internal debris with something like a toothpick. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you can see through the nozzle orifice and there's no junk inside anything, reassemble everything properly and try again. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-04-24T13:23:58.143" CommentCount="0" />

When a slicing engine slices a 3D model, it's goal is to spit out the preferred machine paths in G-Code (of some kind). However, I've read a few articles, done some tests, and heard through the grape vine that anywhere between 10%-35% is good enough for most applications. I once watched a webinar for understanding the new MakerWare interface that explained how they chose such settings. Although I can't find the clip directly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makerbot.com/resources/webinars&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the page for all of MakerBot's webinars. I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.makerbot.com/intro-makerbot-desktop-software-webinar.html?utm_source=leadgen&amp;amp;utm_medium=resource-center&amp;amp;utm_content=webinar&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rc-intro-makerbot-desktop-webinar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; webinar was the one I watched explaining a little bit about preferred infill percentages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From experience, anything over 35% doesn't yield much more strength from infill side of things. Beyond 35% and you're going to want to reconsider how you're orienting the print when you print it and what you're printing to utilize the grain structure for proper strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, infill percentage/patterns are not the only variable for creating strong parts. Infill is really just a way to save time and material. Here are some other ways to potentially increase strength:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Increase your shell. Shell is the number of profile patterns per layer. Typically (in FDM/FFF), each shell is &lt;strong&gt;about&lt;/strong&gt; the diameter of your extruder nozzle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Increase your floor/roof. Similar to shell, floor/roof refers to the number of layers that make up the &quot;bottom&quot; and &quot;top&quot; of the part with regard to the build plate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Print orientation. Pay attention to which areas of the part are susceptible to strain along the &quot;grain&quot; of the layers. Try to rotate your part on the build plate in a way that minimizes potential failure both in print and post-print use.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Post process. Don't be afraid to do some post-processing to increase the strength. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://markforged.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;some 3D printers on the market&lt;/a&gt; that go as far as including Kevlar strands in the printing process to beef up their prints. However, it may be as simple as just coating the part in an epoxy with some basic finishing techniques. It's a bit more work, but it turns weak 3D printed parts into full production quality prints.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Based on some of the comments, it sounds like your best bet might be to find a custom application that can either convert the g-code file into a solid model (try CAM software?), or create a plugin for your CAD software (I know Unigraphics NX and Solidworks allow for this) and essentially recreate your own slicing engine that takes your solid model and generates the same infill pattern dynamically inside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps look into the works of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simlab-soft.com/index.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Simlab&lt;/a&gt; or similar which has a lot of 3D software plugins.

The bars should not only vary in infill percentages, but in also the various infill patterns. Depending on the type of stresses and loads applied, different patterns may be stronger at lower infill rates, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, the infill rate should correlate to the thickness of the bottom, top, and sidewalls. This is especially important with ABS when it comes to shrinkage, warping, and delayering. In order for the part to be universally as strong as possible, as the part cools, it must shrink evenly. This is a well known factor for machinists creating molds for injection molding and casting. Otherwise, you may have unintended additional points of weaknesses arise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if creating tensile bars, make sure to take into account the shrinkage experienced along each axis, for each individual example. I would also suggest cutting each one open, as well as attempting to break a few of the apart (in a very crude way).

And to accelerate and decelerate a motor under load, you need to finely vary their timing.  Back when I/O ports hung directly off processor buses, and operating systems could not prevent programs from speeding up the system hardware timer in order to run a stepper routine rapidly, this worked to a degree.  But today:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most PC class processors have little, if any directly coupled I/O - especially by the time you get outside the box.  An interface like USB is great for moving a large amount of data per unit time, but it is absolutely horrible for accomplishing a trivial task with precise, frequent timing - it is a freight train, not a bicycle courier.  Many of the things which let a processor internally operate quickly specifically work by decoupling it from an outside world that often cannot keep up - memory caches, bus exchange units, etc.  If you do find a parallel port today, it is likely to be on the far side of a PCI bus bridge at the least, and have a different low-level interface than a legacy one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern operating systems have a time-slice scheduler which &quot;owns&quot; the CPU(s) and hands out small chunks of processing time to ordinary programs.  These programs typically get to run often enough to appear responsive to the user, but not frequently enough to accurately drive stepper motors.  There are various schemes which have been tried, for example to create a &quot;hard real time&quot; scheduler which owns the processor, and allows a motor control task to register for precisely needed time slices - then, with whatever time is left over a Linux or Windows or similar kernel is allowed to run, and divide up the remaining time among ordinary programs through its scheduling rules.  Of course, such a scheme tends to need to be revised each time the utilized conventional operating system has a new major release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While there are ways around these issues, they tend to require atypical hardware and deep changes to the operating system installation - making them neither inexpensive nor easy to setup for end users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it is generally simpler and more cost effective (not even $10 these days) to put an embedded processor on an external circuit board, and have it act as a delegate to execute precise-timing tasks on behalf of the host processor.  Somewhat extending from the idea of industrial CNC machines that originally read punched paper tape, and were later updated with a scheme where an ordinary computer &quot;drip feeds&quot; G-code commands over a serial port, modern 3D Printers tend to deliver G-code (or other) command data a little bit in advance of when it is needed, so that the latency of a USB or serial connection doesn't really matter.  Normally enough data is buffered on the printer for it to keep running, but even if not it would only pause briefly between the complete moves which are transmitted, not experience motor stuttering as it would if the USB were trying to deliver each individual step pulse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for why an Arduino - probably mostly the history of who built the machines which kicked off the enthusiast printing trend.  If someone from an industrial background were tasked with building something like an FDM printer or a machine with similar motion needs in isolation today, chances are they would end up with an ARM processor that would be a bit faster, more flexible, and with more resources, and likely cost a little less.  But in actual history, the early affordable machines were built by those in maker community, who were already familiar with the availability of the Arduino, and willing to put some cleverness into getting good motion out of its limitations.  RAMPS in particular seems designed to be a coarse-pitch through-hole bridge that a hobbyist could build themselves, and then buy the slightly trickier to work with surface mount processor and motor drive chips preassembled in the form of an Arduino Mega and stepper drive modules.  That even fairly propriety machines maintain these basic parts choices is probably an indication of the utility of not &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; - if you want to develop a printer, you can start from available components and customize them only one by one as you choose, rather than not being able to run your development prototype until you get a working circuit board designed and fabbed, a working software base developed, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1378" LastEditorUserId="1378" LastEditDate="2016-05-03T15:46:29.070" LastActivityDate="2016-05-03T15:46:29.070" CommentCount="0" />

The underlying machine code can write an entire byte to set the status of all 8 pins at once. So in principle, all the step pins on the RAMBO board can be triggered exactly simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Arduino IDE hides this behavior from firmwares by abstracting the port's byte handling as a function call for each individual pin. That means programmers only have to know the Arduino PIN number, not which port and position on the processor is being used. And then the modern firmwares typically used by RAMBO do a further layer of abstraction to make it easy for the same firmware to be used by different boards, by changing pin assigned names in a config file (usually pins.h) and not assuming any specific port selection was made during board design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's no guarantee for open-source firmware that a particular pin selection was made in hardware. Lots of 3D printer controller boards even have pretty dumb pin assignments, like using hardware-PWM-capable pins for stepper signals rather than PWM'd heaters. Marlin and Repetier have chosen flexibility over performance optimization in this regard. They pretty much let the board designer use any pin for anything. When they have to do stuff like run heater PWM control or fire a bunch of step pulses as fast as possible, they emulate that in software rather than taking advantage of specific hardware that isn't always available. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this specific case, there may not actually be all that much performance gain/loss. Writing to an output pin is pretty fast. The amount of time difference between firing a few step pulses in sync or firing them sequentially is on the order of a few microseconds. That won't make any difference to the motion fidelity of the printer's physical drivetrains.

Typical printing temperatures can range anywhere from 200-225c for PLA (depending on the supplier). Often, if the extruder is too hot, the material will bubble or over extrude.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is the material of proper quality? There's a reason MakerBot Industries wants you to use their filament (besides putting their hands in your pocket book), and that is repeatability. They've tested their filament on their hardware and ensured that the material will extrude with regular print settings.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is the material being stored properly? Sometimes people forget to store PLA in a dry place to avoid absorbing moisture in the filament. If moisture is absorbed, it can perform poorly in the print. Indications of moisture can include a slight steam from the extruder and/or bubbles in the extruded material (similar to over heating).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are the fans operating correctly? If the fans aren't running or aren't running enough, the filament begins to heat further up the extrusion assembly (closer to the drive gear) which can inhibit extrusion. I know that MakerWare/MakerBot Desktop has been updated lately with more emphasis on controlling fans for active cooling, so make sure that your fan(s) are operating for duration of the print as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All and all, your filament is getting too hot. If you can't determine the sudden change, consider printing with a lower extruder temperature from now on.

Delamination or edge/corner cracking is caused by warping stresses when the first layer adhesion is stronger than the interlayer bonding. Or it happens when the heated build plate allows a strong non-warping foundation to be built until the print is too tall to be adequately warmed by the plate. In either case, the corners of the first layer can't lift, so the print cracks elsewhere to relieve the stress. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All ABS warping stress, in turn, is caused by the repeated thermal contraction of the fresh plastic layer at the top of the print. The FDM process sticks hot, expanded plastic onto cool, contracted plastic. When the new layer cools, it tries to contract, but it's stuck to a layer that is already fully cooled/contracted. This generates a large shear stress between the two layers. The accumulation of those shear stresses over many consecutive layers generates a large-scale bending force on the entire print. That's what causes both warping and delamination. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/HZZam.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/HZZam.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The less the previous layer cools below the glass point of the plastic, the less thermal contraction it experiences before the next layer goes down, and therefore the less warping stress will accumulate as the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; layer cools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Environment temp is the biggest thing you can control:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your printer's environment is below 35C, you probably shouldn't even bother printing ABS. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A 50C environment is significantly better and will have minimal problems with warping and delamination. This is within the ambient temp ratings of most motors and electronics. Air-cooled extruders can typically extrude ABS reliably up to about 60C ambient, at which point they may be prone to clogging. And don't forget about plastic structural parts in your printer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Industrial ABS printers with heated build chambers print ABS in a 75-85C environment, with lots of airflow. In terms of cooling regimes, ABS in an 80C chamber acts very similar to PLA in a room-temp environment.

Please be aware that printing a object is yet not as easy as printing on paper. The machines that print 3D are more like industrial machines than that they are like your inkjet printer at home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the curious beginner I would suggest to  first concentrate on modelling and printing technique.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Modeling&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can of course download things from ThingyVerse or YouMagine but you might be more interested in &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; things than printing them. I don't know Windows 10 3D design. I personally find Sketchup Modeling software a good entry-point because they have a large set of video tutorials and while you learn you can add more complicated extensions to the program. There are also extensions that help you make your model 'watertight' and 'ready for print'.&#xA;Of course you can find heaps of tutorials on Youtube for other modeling software like freeCAD or Fusion but you might find it a bit overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Printing&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As suggested in the comments, you could start with letting your objects print by others. It's worth to set aside a small budget for that.&#xA;They easiest to design for is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shapeways.com/additive-manufacturing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SLS printing&lt;/a&gt;. You don't have to worry about overhangs etc. Buying a SLS printer is not an option but you can have it print at multiple printingfarms like Shapeways.&#xA;You soon enough find out that making a print 'light' and hollow will save a lot of cash. Shapeways will tell you if there is anything wrong with your design too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bit harder is FDM printing where layers of threads are stacked. Because overhangs need support, most of the time extra plastic is printed that has to be removed later.  Plastic is not expensive and insides can be printed hollow, so cost is not so much a thing you have to worry about when designing.&#xA;On 3Dhubs you can find experienced people who own a printer and want to print for you. They can tell you what is printable and what not. If you have a hub near you this is a good option to get familiar with the technique.&#xA;If you did that a couple of times you can decide to go to a fablab or makerspace where you lent/rent a printer. Make yourself familiar with slicing software like Cura before you go.

I could be wrong in my concern for some modules that address these kind of issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if we narrow down between mechanical and magnetic:&#xA; - Magnetic would provide a gentler approach, reducing (potentially) the amount of wear&#xA; - However, I'm assuming, magnetic switches require &quot;dialing in&quot; depending on the components used in the sensor. This could lead to an undesired range that the sensor is triggered.&#xA; - Mechanical switches are simple.

The important thing is merely that the slicer and printer coordinate systems match, so parts actually come out where your slicer thinks they should. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, it's usually quite easy to tell what's &quot;front&quot; in your slicer's build volume.

How much spread is there in the trigger position? Do environmental changes or machine setting changes affect the trigger position?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Contact distance: does the switch register with enough clearance to its hard-stop that the homing axis can stop before colliding with something?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Noise-rejection: does the switch ONLY trigger when it is supposed to? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's important to ask, how much switch precision do we actually need? A typical 3d printer drivetrain using a microstepping stepper motor can only accurately position the moving load within +/- one 1/16th microstep (even if using finer microstepping than that) due to error-inducing effects like friction torque and magnetic detent angle error. That's around +/-0.01mm for most printers. The homing switch only needs to be as precise as the motor's positioning! Nothing is gained by having, say, 0.001mm precision endstops. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This precision of +/-0.01mm is achievable for all types of endstop switches, with proper switch selection and configuration. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there are three &quot;standard&quot; switching types in use in consumer/hobbyist 3d printers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mechanical switches, typically dual NO/NC limit switches, which either pull up or pull down a signal pin by connecting an electrical circuit when triggered&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Optical switches, which use transistors to detect when an obstacle (&quot;flag&quot;) is blocking the window between the emitter and sensor&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hall effect switches, which use transistors to detect when a magnetic field exceeds a particular field strength cutoff&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanical Switches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Precision/repeatability depends on the switch quality, length of lever arm attached (longer increases contact distance but is worse for precision), and impact speed of the carriage with the switch. It's possible to have a good mechanical switch or a bad mechanical switch. This is typically a reasonable default choice because it is simple and cheap. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A small mechanical switch with a short lever arm (or the lever arm removed) will generally achieve the required +/-0.01mm switching precision. Very cheap switches, high contact speeds, and long lever arms may provide inadequate resolution for Z homing or probing, but will still be adequate for low-precision X and Y homing purposes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where mechanical switches tend to cause issues is in noise rejection. Different controller boards use different ways of wiring the switch: some use two wires and only send a signal when triggered. When not triggered, the signal wire is left floating or weakly pulled up by the microcontroller, while attached to a long wire that acts as an antenna to pick up EM noise. It is VERY common for heater or stepper wiring to emit nasty EMR due to the PWM current control. Two-wire endstop cables should always be run away from stepper and heater wiring. Shielding and twisting the conductors is a good idea too. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A more robust approach is to use three-wire switches that actively pull the signal line high or low depending on the switch position. These will tend to reject noise better. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Very cheap mechanical switches may fail within the life of the printer. However, most limit switches are rated for millions of cycles, which is unlikely to occur over any normal printer's lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mechanical switches are easy to align and easy to trigger by hand during troubleshooting. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optical Switches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These rely on a flag blocking a window between a light emitter and a detector. This is non-contact and can be quite reliable, but introduces some challenges. The exact trigger position (and thus precision) may depend on ambient light levels in the room, because the sensor is monitoring for light to decrease below a specific intensity. So it may be very repeatable/precise in the short term but have some drift if the sensor moves in and out of the sun through the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Switching tends to be more consistent and reliable if the flag enters the window from the side, rather than the top. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Optical switches will actively pull the signal line high or low, and thus have good electrical noise rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hall Effect Switches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These measure the intensity of the nearby magnetic field and trigger when it exceeds a certain amount in a certain polarity. This is highly precise/repeatable (better than +/-0.01mm) and extremely resistant to noise and environmental conditions. (Unless your printer is next to something that emits large magnetic fields, anyway.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hall switches I've seen have an adjustable trim pot to tune the trigger distance. That's a nice feature when trying to manually calibrate a Delta or a Z-bed for first layer height. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The primary downside to hall switches is that they need a magnet to trigger the switch. This can be difficult to trigger by hand during troubleshooting, and requires attaching a magnet somewhere on the moving carriage.

There are no printable thermoplastics available to consumers/hobbyists that will reliably AND safely contain coffee/tea temperature beverages.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though some plastics may appear mechanically suitable at first sight, there are long-term issues with using thermoplastics for elevated temperature service. The material becomes weaker and less dimensionally stable under load as the temperature approaches the glass point of the polymer. For example, here is some Stratasys test data for ABS strength versus temperature:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/PN3QJ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/PN3QJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if the plastic survives a few uses, it may creep and warp over time. And that might be fine, depending on your needs! People have printed working coffee cups out of ABS before. For some definition of &quot;working&quot; you can make print a working coffee mug. It's just not going to work at the level of longevity and reliability that people typically expect from hot beverage containers. (Imagine if the handle breaks and pours scalding liquid in your lap.) PLA in particular tends to give out abruptly due to its unusual ability to creep to ultimate failure with very low elongations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there is the question of whether ANY FDM printed part is ever safe for &lt;em&gt;repeated&lt;/em&gt; food service use. One-time uses (such as throw-away cookie cutters) might be perfectly fine, but repeated use introduces additional problems because FDM parts are porous. They contain a microscopic void/grain structure that is perfect for trapping food debris and sheltering bacteria. Every FDM part is similar in that regard to an old, scratched, wooden cutting board. They are difficult to effectively sanitize. A high-temp dishwasher cycle will do the job, but that imposes significant thermal stress on thermoplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's an example micrograph I took of voids in a printed part (strands all aligned the same way to highlight the shape):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/wfYtx.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/wfYtx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These voids will also allow liquids to leak unless careful print settings are used. Over-extruding with multiple perimeters, or doing some kind of post-print sealing can make water-tight parts. It's not hard, just takes some experimenting. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also considerable anecdotal evidence that much of the cheap filament from Asia is full of nasty, toxic substances that may leach into hot beverages. Heavy metals like lead, strontrium, and cadmium are often found in thermoplastics as processing aids, pigments, or simply from unscrupulous companies disposing of industrial ashes by mixing them into dark-colored filaments for export. US-made and EU-made filaments seem to be better in this regard. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that the basic issues are out of the way... Here is the breakdown of specific materials you might want to try:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA&lt;/strong&gt; blends used in 3d printing will soften and fail almost instantly on contact with hot beverages. (They contain melt-reducers and viscosity modifiers and polymer molecular weights specific to FDM filament and will perform differently from injection-molded PLA products.) It is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to anneal PLA to survive higher temperatures, as this increases the crystallinity of the polymer and thus makes it more heat-stable. However, that is highly experimental and results will vary considerably with filament provider, color/pigment, and annealing process used. Even annealed PLA is unlikely to survive long-term against very hot beverages and dishwasher use.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABS&lt;/strong&gt; will become fairly weak at hot beverage temperatures. It may survive use for a while, but is quite weak and will slowly creep with very hot beverages or in a high-temp dishwasher. ABS IS approved for food use in many contexts, despite what many people think, but hot beverages are not one of the approved uses.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PET&lt;/strong&gt; blends are chemically a pretty good choice -- soda bottles are PET -- but generally have glass points around 70-75C and thus will be weak or fail outright at hot beverage temperatures. It is also important to ask what is being blended into the PET. For example, PETG is &quot;glycol modified&quot; but filament vendors do not share any details about this or reveal how it may affect the polymer's leaching behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most &lt;strong&gt;nylons&lt;/strong&gt; will creep under load at surprisingly low temperatures, perhaps 50-55C depending on the blend. Nylons are also attacked by acids and will absorb stains and smells from coffee. Nylons also tend to swell/shrink quite dramatically on exposure to water, so mechanical fit and general shape of nylon parts may not be stable enough even for cold beverage service. &lt;strong&gt;Taulman's 910 is probably a good candidate for hot beverage service due to its high working temperature&lt;/strong&gt;, but acid attack from coffee exposure may still be an issue in the long run. It's worth trying. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polycarbonate&lt;/strong&gt; is thermally stable even in boiling water, so mechanically it is fine, but PC leaches BPA (one of the monomers left over from manufacture) into hot liquids. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;High-temp exotics like Ultem and PEEK aren't printable by consumer/hobbyist printers at the size scale required for a coffee mug. They simply warp too much unless you have an oven for a heated build chamber. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; make a working coffee mug via FDM printing, but it isn't a great idea. &lt;strong&gt;Your best bet for 3d printing a coffee mug is ordering ceramic printed from an online service bureau.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-05-09T16:14:29.243" CommentCount="2" />

Either will work, but there are trade-offs involved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Various considerations that may come into play:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A flat sheet of aluminum has better &lt;strong&gt;stiffness/weight ratio&lt;/strong&gt; than a flat sheet of steel. If weight/mass is a concern, such as with a Mendel style moving Y-bed, aluminum may be superior to an equivalent stiffness steel sheet. On the other hand, steel has the superior &lt;strong&gt;stiffness/thickness ratio&lt;/strong&gt;, so if the total thickness of the plate is constrained, such as by the printer's mounting hardware, steel may be higher performance. In short, for sheets of equivalent stiffness, aluminum will be thicker but lighter. That may or may not matter for your specific printer. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Differential thermal expansion can be an issue, depending on what the plate is attached to. For example, rigidly bolting a steel sheet to an aluminum sub-frame will cause the structure to warp when its temperature changes. Likewise for bolting an aluminum sheet to a steel sub-frame. Bed mounts that &quot;float&quot; will not cause warping in either case. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All kinds of rolled sheet metal may have a tendency to warp when heated/cooled, due to residual stresses and grain alignment effects from manufacture. When people want extreme dimensional stability for the flattest and lowest-warp print bed possible, an aluminum cast tooling plate material such as MIC 6 is usually used. The MIC 6 sheet is then precision ground to be flat. Of course, that adds cost. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Neither aluminum nor steel is a particularly good &lt;em&gt;bare&lt;/em&gt; print surface. Either will need some kind of adhesion layer, like Kapton tape or gluestick. The adhesion layer matters far more than the type of metal underneath.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aluminum sheets are often used as &lt;strong&gt;heat-spreaders&lt;/strong&gt; to even out the bed temperature of heated beds. This is very important when heaters are smaller than the total bed size, or have hot spots. (Most heaters do have hot spots.) Steel is a relatively poor conductor of heat, so the surface of the bed will take longer to heat up and will be less even. That may or may not be an issue, depending on the printer and desired materials. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it's really a holistic design decision. Aluminum is far more common because of its thermal properties and lower weight, but steel print beds (particularly with permanent adhesion coatings) are often used too. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-05-12T17:42:49.340" CommentCount="0" />

That screws up the extrusion volume. The correct volume calibration procedure for S3D is: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Measure actual average filament diameter and input that&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Print a 100% infill calibration cubes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the print is over-extruded (top or sides bulging), decrease Extrusion Multiplier by about 0.05 and try again. If the print is under-extruded or looks clean, increase Extrusion Multiplier by about 0.05 and try again.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Repeat as needed to dial it in. The correct value of Extrusion Multiplier is the largest value that does not produce over-extruded prints. This produces minimum void volume and strong parts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the future, that specific material+extruder combination will always have the same extrusion multiplier. You only need to measure and input filament diameter and you will always get accurate volume output. (And if you use high-quality filament with consistent diameter, you don't even really need to measure the diameter.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to measure perimeters, you can do 3 perimeters and divide the measurement by 3. That takes into account most of the overlap and will be much closer to accurate than a single-perimeter measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMPLETE ANSWER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to fill the print volume as completely as possible (at least in the &quot;solid&quot; parts of the print like perimeters, roofs, and floors). Empty space between strands doesn't contribute to part strength. In fact, voids act as failure initiation sites by concentrating stresses. Because extruded strands come out with rounded edges, they have to be &lt;strong&gt;overlapped&lt;/strong&gt; to squeeze plastic into gaps and minimize &quot;corner voids.&quot; That looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/mcSqs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/mcSqs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where the bulges overlap, the excess plastic gets pushed into the corners to &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; fill the voids. It's very difficult to get 100% packing density, but you can get pretty close if you calibrate volume correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/WyZkl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/WyZkl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You DO NOT want to space the strands without overlap. That makes very weak prints and looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/QGKY6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/QGKY6.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get the right amount of strand overlap, the slicer has to do some math and make some assumptions about how you're calibrating it. This is not uniform between software packages. So it's important to understand what &quot;extrusion width&quot; means to different slicers. For a couple prominent examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Slic3r treats &quot;extrusion width&quot; as the measured outside dimension of a stack of strands. Adjacent strands are then positioned closer together than the nominal width according to a somewhat complicated equation to get sufficient overlap for bonding.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;S3D treats &quot;extrusion width&quot; as the average width of the stack of strands, which is the equivalent width if the plastic strands were extruded as ideal rectangles instead of a stack of ovals. Adjacent strands are positioned 1x nominal extrusion width apart. That provides the correct amount of overlap without any extra math. But each individual strand is really somewhat wider than the nominal &quot;width.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/gtCAm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/gtCAm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both of these techniques can produce the exact same output if calibrated properly, but they require different calibration techniques because they calculate the plastic volume and adjacent strand spacing different ways. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's important to understand that S3D spaces its strands 1x extrusion width apart. When you use the measured perimeter thickness to calibrate Simplify3D for extrusion width setting = measured thickness, you get under-extruded prints with no strand overlap. &lt;strong&gt;S3D's strands must measure wider than the &quot;width&quot; setting to get the correct overlap.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, S3D's code is smart enough to know how this affects print dimenions, and will adjust perimeter positions to get accurate overall dimensions. But single-wall test boxes will be thicker than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The downside to the way Slic3r calculates volume is that it is only accurate for strands that are shaped like ovals. And that is only an accurate assumption when [extrusion width &gt; nozzle width + layer height]. The strand must be wide enough for molten plastic to flow sideways and develop the circular bulge cross-section. So people almost always print with wider strands in Slic3r than is strictly necessary. The volume calculations don't work all that well with thin strands. Whereas S3D's volume calculation method works fine with pretty much any extrusion width greater than layer height and greater than nozzle diameter. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are pros and cons to both systems. You just need to understand the correct calibration technique for each. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastEditorUserId="298" LastEditDate="2016-05-25T17:31:57.253" LastActivityDate="2016-05-25T17:31:57.253" CommentCount="3" />

Which is obvious as structure of the object should store construction of an object but not its position. So position is relation-to-something so to speak and because object itself doesn't contain any information about object environment then there is no position stored.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there is one hack. All coordinates stored inside object are in fact a realtion to some starting point. Let's say it's a zero-point or starting point of the coordinate system of the object. This is sometimes anoying because it's usually bottom left corner or center of the object. Unfortunately some applications store this starting point out of the object. This means that object has starting point in some point but this point is outside of the object itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This cause the situation when user loads an object in another application then object is translated in &quot;strange&quot; position.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Position of the object in printing application.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When user loads an object into printing application then object is usualy set in the center of build plate. This also sounds obvious but if inner coordinate system of the object is translated then object can be repositioned even out of the build plate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what is the solution for such situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two options.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Manage object coordinate system in the application which create STL file  or convert object into STL format or&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Manage (switch off) option called &quot;center on build plate&quot; or &quot;center on the bed&quot; or &quot;center object&quot; or &quot;auto-center parts&quot; in printing application.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then it will be possible (or easier) to position object according to user needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another issue is STL object which is in fact kinda assembly of separate objects. If you encounter such situation. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:337423&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here for example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/a2uAls.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/a2uAls.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:337423&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These two guys are stored in one STL file so they have common coordinate system and common starting point. All above applies to such assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Applications allows user to split such assembly into separate objects so each one can be repositioned separately.

But it does depend on the slicer and settings. Some slicers (like Slic3r) will auto-decimate toolpaths to ensure that the rate of motion commands isn't too difficult for the old, slow 8bit processors in most consumer/hobbyist 3d printers. Having a large number of very small motion commands can bog down these motion controllers and cause pause-stuttering that creates little zits on the print. Most slicers simply reduce model detail level to safeguard the motion controller. Because the contours are decimated to a minimum motion segment length, very small model triangles are irrelevant to printer performance. At the most, they might add a marginal amount of slicing time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some slicers (like Simplify3d) assume you have the correct level of detail you want in your model, and will pretty faithfully reproduce the model file's contours in the sliced toolpath. If your entire model is very high mesh density / poly count in general, or if your high-density mesh regions are crossed by a layer slice, this can produce a series of very, very short motion commands. Sometimes the motion commands are even smaller than the motion resolution of the printer, and simply take up processor time (to evaluate and drop from the queue) with no benefit to print fidelity. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a more general sense, high-poly models are dramatically more difficult for the 3d printer to reproduce accurately. There are two big issues: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Each motion segment requires some processor time to read/receive, parse, and execute. But the shorter the segment lengths are, the faster the printer runs through them. A short move takes little time to perform but still has the same processor load as a long move. At a certain point, the processor can't keep up, and performance suffers. The printer may run out of queued moves to execute and pause in place, or it may violate acceleration limits and violently clunk through corners (or even lose position) because it didn't have enough time to iterate through the calculations that determine how fast it should move.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The algorithms used by most consumer/hobbyist 3d printer firmwares (Marlin, Repetier, Sailfish, Smoothieware, etc) are based on GRBL. And without getting into the math, GRBL uses the sharpness of the corners between motion segments to decide how fast to travel through the corner. So a 90 degree turn will trigger a considerable slowdown, while a series of small angles (such as many small segments comprising a curved surface) is not recognized by the algorithm, and it will try to barrel through the curve at full speed. On long, gentle curves, this is fine, but high-poly &lt;em&gt;tight&lt;/em&gt; curves (such as a filleted edge or organic model detail) are traversed far too fast because no slowdowns are triggered. This means high-poly models must be printed at much lower feedrates / target speeds, because the acceleration algorithm can't figure out when to go fast or slow. Whereas a blocky, low-poly model can be printed much faster and the acceleration code will speed up and slow down as needed for good quality. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are primarily issues with high vertex density versus low vertex density, not variable density. Small pockets of high detail are usually not problematic, as long as they are small enough that the motion planner queue (say, 16 segments) doesn't get filled with too many very small movements. A few small segments in a row is ok, but a few dozen is not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are limitations baked into the algorithms used by today's slicers and motion controllers. In the future, they may not be so problematic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-05-16T15:51:57.763" CommentCount="2" />

Then, use a small fan to quickly cool the platform (or at least quicker than room temperature). An ice pack on the build plate/part could also work. This drastic fluctuation between the build platform (or BuildTak) and the part should make it easier to remove the part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This works because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_coefficient&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;temperature coefficient&lt;/a&gt; is going to be different between the build plate, BuildTak, and the 3D printed part. So, each part rises and falls in temperature at different rates. When objects are heated and cooled, they expand and contract (respectively). Essentially, as each object expands and contracts at different rates, the objects begin to separate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good example is if you've ever placed a jar into the fridge/freezer to make it easier to open. Typically the jar is glass and the lid is either plastic or metal. You'll notice that the lid is significantly easier to open, as opposed to its original state, because the lid and the jar physically react differently to temperature changes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://all3dp.com/6-ways-remove-3d-prints-build-platform/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here is a good article&lt;/a&gt; explaining a few different ways to remove a stuck part. (for prosperity sake, here's a quick list):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brute force. Just try to yank on it until it pries off.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sharp objects. Try using a small blade to get under a corner of the part and wiggle the part a bit. Careful not to break the blade and send it flying.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Utilize temperature difference. I already explained this above.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use solvents. I didn't know this, but apparently there are solvents in the market that are targeted for 3D printing maintenance. Essentially its just an alcohol-based liquid...&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use floss. Another cool idea that's related to using a sharp object, using dental floss. Basically, any small object that you can remotely wiggle under the part and give you more leverage to yank on it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Invest in a flexible build platform.

For example, the Peachy 3D printer Kickstarter just imploded and failed. There have been many other failed low-cost 3D printer crowdfunding campaigns. Another low cost Kickstarter printer, the 101Hero, is ongoing now (May 2016), but most competent observers I've talked to don't believe it will succeed at delivering working printers to all backers at that price point. If they do deliver, it will be painfully low-cost components and the printer will not perform well or last long. &lt;strong&gt;Stay away from crowdfunding campaigns for your first printer.&lt;/strong&gt; At best, you get a beta product with lots of kinks to work out. At worst, you get nothing and lose your money. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For actual products you can purchase today, there's a wide spectrum of quality/cost tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Under $200 there's nothing credible. The Tiko ($179) might deliver, but post-Kickstarter units are widely expected to cost more.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Around $200-300 you get into low-quality Prusa i3 kits from China. These aren't a great value -- most people end up spending another few hundred dollars on upgrades to get them working reliably and with high quaity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Around $300-400 you can get an &lt;em&gt;ok&lt;/em&gt; 3D printer, often with &quot;chipped&quot; proprietary filament so the vendor can make high profits on locked-in consumables. (&quot;Razors and blades&quot; model.) For example, the XYZPrinting Da Vinci Jr is $350 but locks you into high-cost chipped filament. The Wanhao Duplicator i3 is currently a community favorite for value-for-money at $399. The Printrbot Play is much higher quality/reliability but much smaller at the same price. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you get up around $600, a big range of decent printers opens up. But this is no longer the &quot;least expensive&quot; option, so I won't get into it. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to tinker, the Duplicator i3 is a good choice. If you want a machine that just prints, the Play is a good choice.

I'm using an UM2, colorFabb XT 1.75mm and Slic3r. Before printing a test cube I made flow rate adjustments using the &quot;Perimeter test&quot; (printed a hallow cube with 1 layer thin perimeter line). I then compared the desired value of the perimeter's width with the value from the g-code and adjusted the flow rate. I repeated this procedure until I got exactly the thickness I needed. After that, I printed a 15x15x15 mm cube and observed under extrusion on top layer. Also, the dimensions of the cube in the x-y plane were smaller than expected (0.4mm shorter than they should be). I have done this a few times now, and still get the same result. :/ Furthermore, I was unable to adjust width by dividing the desired value of the width of the perimeter by a real value, I got slightly smaller extrusion multiplier (One I got by division is 0.9 , but 9.5 relates to desired width).

I had similar effect when I used extensive retraction with low quality filament. In fact filament was to soft and when it was pressed to hobbed pulley/bolt it became flatened and then stopped flowing. So if your case is similar you could check the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;spring tenssion&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;knurls&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;filament diameter&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also worth to check if hobbed pulley is screwed tight on motor shaft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[edit]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It could be also caused by too fast retraction if knurls are not sharp enough they can slide on or scrap filament.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you notice that again, stop printing proces, lose springs and pull out filament from hotend and inspect its shape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1211" LastEditorUserId="1211" LastEditDate="2016-05-25T06:11:12.000" LastActivityDate="2016-05-25T06:11:12.000" CommentCount="3" />

In fact, whether any particular material is approved by regulators (such as the US FDA) for food contact is much more complex than most people realize. Materials can be accepted for some uses and not others. But there are two major considerations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Does the material leach into the food, or does the food leach into the material?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Can the material be adequately cleaned and sterilized between repeated food exposures?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether leaching is a concern will depend on the kind of contact. For example, nylon will absorb acids but is often used for potable water service. ABS is fine for cold foods but not hot foods. PLA (injection grade) is often used for disposable plastic forks and cold beverage cups, but rarely reusable containers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is some anecdotal evidence that lots of 3D printing filaments, particularly cheap Asian filaments, contain toxic chemicals in the pigments and additives. Heavy metals like lead, cadmium, strontium, and all sorts of nasty organic chemicals have been found. You probably WON'T get any meaningful leaching of these chemicals in the brief exposure with cookie dough, but to be safe I would only use reputable US and EU filament manufacturers for food contact. I would also stick to filament colors that use non-toxic pigments (eg plain white is almost always safe titanium dioxide) or no pigments at all (&quot;natural&quot; color). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cleaning a cookie cutter for multiple uses, ABS is probably a much better choice than PLA, because ABS can withstand fairly hot water without losing shape. PLA probably won't survive a cycle through the dishwasher. PETG is perhaps a better choice than ABS for longer contact with wet foods, but may or may not survive the dishwasher. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the porous structure of 3D printed parts is a serious problem for cleanliness. The tiny grain structure and voids between extruded strands can act as a safe haven for bacteria between uses. This is particularly an issue with cookie dough containing raw egg. A porous surface for raw-food handling would not be acceptable in a commercial kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the odds of actually transmitting salmonella via poorly-cleaned cookie cutter may be fairly low. Lots of people cut meat at home on wooden cutting boards (which are also porous) and never get sick. Properly cooking the food immediately after handling will go a long way towards reducing the odds of harmful cross-contamination. You'll have to decide for yourself whether the risk profile is worth it. One-time use is the conservative choice. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-05-31T18:20:54.407" CommentCount="0" />

Unfortunately, this isn't yet a very economical or simple operation. A decent filament extruder capable of holding acceptable diameter tolerances is around $1000, and even then they can be pretty fidgety to operate. You have to have a LOT of volume throughput in your filament extruder for regrinding to be an economical proposition. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the reasons why recycling prints into filament can be difficult:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most plastics will degrade to some extent each time they are extruded. (Both by the 3d printer and by the filament extruder.) PLA will thermally degrade with extended exposure to heat. PET will hydrolyze and break down if not meticulously dried to remove moisture prior to heating to the melting temp. (PETG seems to be less prone to hydrolysis damage than plastic bottle PET, but it still happens to a limited degree.) ABS holds up to extrusion conditions better than most, which is part of why it's favored for injection molding, but there's still the potential to affect properties by depleting additives or cooking out plasticizers. &lt;strong&gt;In practice, this means regrinds generally need to be mixed with fresh pellets at some ratio.&lt;/strong&gt; That dilutes the degraded or additive-depleted polymer with good material so you can maintain the material properties and performance. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you print a variety of different colors, and don't want all your recycled filament to mix and end up a muddy brownish color, it can be difficult to manage the color sorting and matching. Most people don't want different colors along the length of a spool, either. So the regrind has to be mixed evenly in with virgin pellets and a suitable amount of masterbatch colorant to get a reasonable color output. You're not going to run off a new spool with 95% virgin pellets just to recycle a 50 gram failed print, are you? Likewise for material matching. Mixing materials is a bad idea. &lt;strong&gt;If you only print white PLA, this is all pretty easy to manage. But if you print a variety of colors and materials, you've got to set up a material tracking, sorting, and storage operation.&lt;/strong&gt; You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do it... it's just a hassle. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Diameter control is difficult. 3D printers need a fairly tight diameter control for reliable performance and good quality. This is really the key challenge in any filament extrusion process. Extruded polymers like to change shape as they extrude and cool due to molecular alignment effects. You can't just push molten plastic out a 1.75mm nozzle -- &quot;die swell&quot; will make the extrudate bulge to a larger diameter immediately upon exiting the nozzle. Then you have to actually &lt;em&gt;pull&lt;/em&gt; on the soft filament as it cools to carefully draw it down to the right diameter. The way the filament extruder measures diameter and controls tension is the key to getting acceptable results. Most hobbyist/desktop filament extruders have not succeeded at this. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those are just the major issues. Filament extrusion is a complex subject with a lot of depth. For a home user of 3d printers, making filament basically becomes a whole second hobby. In my opinion, it only really makes sense in a commercial production printing environment where paid technicians can run the extruder(s) and a very large print throughput makes the pellets+regrind economics much more favorable than just buying new filament. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reducing and reusing are preferable to recycling. Making your printer more reliable and gaining experience with calibration/configuration will reduce the volume of waste produced. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also some productive uses that let you reuse unwanted prints as-is or &quot;downcycle&quot; them for productive uses. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I personally keep a box of failed prints (and calibration prints and&#xA;no-longer-needed prototypes) as showpieces for people who want to&#xA;learn about 3D printing, and as toys for my nieces and nephews. I strongly recommend doing your calibration prints with a &quot;toy&quot; calibration model like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Benchy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1090268&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CaliBlocks&lt;/a&gt;. 3D printing is still new enough that people will happily take dozens of Benchies off your hands for the novelty value.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Failed and unwanted prints can also be used around the workshop for shims, sacrificial&#xA;cushions when clamping or hammering or drilling, or as scrap for experimenting&#xA;with adhesives or post-processing techniques.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ABS scraps are good for making ABS-slurry as a print bed adhesion treatment&#xA;layer, or for solvent-painting and filling gaps in other prints. Unfortunately, most other filaments do not have such convenient and safe solvents.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some people have experimented with putting piles of scrap prints on a cookie sheet in an oven and melting them into multicolor cutting boards. There's a lot you can do with this sort of heavy remelt plate if you get creative.

It has been noted that brass nozzles contain trace amounts of lead. This lead can contaminate the printed part, which may in turn contaminate your mold, which may in turn contaminate your food. I don't think this is of realistic concern, since we're looking at trace amounts of trace amounts of lead.

It is however not food safe for contact with hot food, because at higher temperatures the food may leach certain chemicals out of the plastic.

You can see this in your gcode if you slice files with different layer heights. &lt;em&gt;Before you add special slicer settings and offsets,&lt;/em&gt; if you print 0.1mm layers, the nozzle will start at Z=0.1mm, and if you print 0.3mm layers, the nozzle will start at Z=0.3mm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons this is more complex and less reliable than it seems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different slicers assume different initial tramming gaps.&lt;/strong&gt; And your actual tramming gap may not match that assumption. If the slicer thinks your nozzle is leveled at Z=0 with a real physical gap of 0.1mm to start with, that means gcode Z=0.1mm is actually a 0.2mm gap that must be filled with plastic. So the slicer must compensate by starting lower than the nominal layer height. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what works perfectly for one slicer won't necessarily work correctly for another slicer. And if you tram with a thinner object than the slicer expects (say a post-it note instead of business card) then your first layer will be off.  This is why I personally prefer physical build plate leveling mid-print using screws while watching the strands go down. It bypasses all the assumptions about tramming gaps and just gives you the correct result.

Things like printing the first layer much hotter, or at half speed, or squashed way down and over-extruded, or at 60% layer height, or at 200% extrusion width, will all affect the extrusion volume calibration and the space-filling behavior of the molten plastic flowing onto the bed. The slicer doesn't really have the ability to understand &quot;your&quot; first-layer adhesion recipe. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The combination of incorrect/unknown tramming gap and person-specific first-layer settings is why the slicer can't always get the first layer height and extrusion volume correct across all layer heights. Within some fairly reasonable assumptions, the slicer is smart enough to always correctly relate extruder flow and nozzle position so it fills the space between the nozzle and whatever surface you're printing onto.

This is necessary to develop the proper &quot;cap zone&quot; semi-melt shearing behavior that allows the incoming filament to act like a piston and generate pressure upstream of the nozzle. Pellet extruders have a similar requirement but related to screw/wall shearing rather than filament/wall shearing. If using neither filament nor pellets, such as clay printers, the material must be pumpable by a positive-displacement pump. (It is possible to pump molten metal, but the cost is quite high.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It must form some kind of bond with previously-deposited solid material, without needing to be in a state that will rapidly flow and lose shape.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It must have some combination of low shrinkage, the ability to creep at the printer's ambient temp, and/or low stiffness that allows consecutive layers to be stacked without an unacceptable amount of warping. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Liquid metals tend to have a conflict between &quot;Staying where you put it&quot; and &quot;bonding with the previous layer.&quot; In order for deposited metal to fully bond, the interface material needs to reach the melting point so a true fusion weld occurs. And in order to supply enough heat to remelt the interface without an additional heat source like an arc, the deposited molten metal needs to be very hot. So it will tend to run while it cools. High density and high heat capacity makes it run fast and cool slowly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pretty much every DIY metal 3d print (such as made by wire-feed MIG welders) ends up looking something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/FTyNd.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/FTyNd.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3dprint.com/29944/diy-metal-printing-garage/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://3dprint.com/29944/diy-metal-printing-garage/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, polymers have long molecular chains that allow them to &quot;diffusion weld&quot; and adhere WITHOUT fully remelting the interface. Molten liquid plastic will stick to solid plastic quite effectively. The interface only needs to get hot enough for appreciable diffusion to intertwine the molecular chains. This will occur between the glass point and melting point, without true fusion occurring. So you can print molten plastic at a temperature where it will stay in place long enough to harden, and still get good bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Metals also tend to be very stiff, which encourages warping. It is difficult to build a heated environment of sufficient temperature to properly stress-relieve the thermal contraction stress as the print progresses, whereas with plastic a heated build plate and warm enclosure can permit warping stresses to start relaxing as the print progresses. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is possible to &quot;FDM-style&quot; 3d print filament/wire made of metal alloys that have a wide range between solidus and liquidus.&lt;/strong&gt; It has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/adablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MetalPrinting.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;been done using solder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.reprap.org/2011/06/new-approach-to-printing-metals.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;similar alloys&lt;/a&gt;.

Pay attention to Ryan Carlyle's response in &lt;a href=&quot;http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/768/filament-guides-drag&quot;&gt;the question I posted&lt;/a&gt;. His post essentially explains various ways that guide tubes may hinder extrusion due to drag. In regards to the length of your guide tubes, ensure that the tube is relatively straight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are holding the filament above the machine, chances are that you wont really need the tubes anyways and the distance between the spool and the extruder won't matter either. The point of tube is to ensure the filament doesn't bind coming from the back of the machine, thus potentially clogging your extruder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Based on the OP's drawing, I think it would benefit to change the design to drop the tubes all together. The tubes can provide many point of contact and managing so many lines at once may become problematic. So, possibly drop the tubes and intend on not drawing your filament unless they are fed into the extruder. You could install smaller ends of tubes at either end of assembly (one at the storage rack, the other above the extruder) to ensure the filament is being fed/pulled straight.

It does not answer your question, but hopefully may help many people who are reading the question when choosing between the two materials.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acrylic is less stable and will probably wear off faster than a well-built MDF frame for a 3D printer! I will address the points separately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An MDF frame has much(!) more mass than acrylic, which will reduce vibrations immediately. Almost more important, a box frame, as typical for the Prusa i3 for example, stabilizes itself intrinsically more by its 'redundant wall' design (don't beat me up over the wording here, I didn't find a better way to describe the property that results from the towers.)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Compare these two images taken from &lt;a href=&quot;http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reprap wiki Prusa i3&lt;/a&gt;:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/h4rDp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/h4rDp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;boxframe (from reprap-wiki)&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/PkWVF.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/PkWVF.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;metal frame (from reprap-wiki)&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;You will probably not find an acrylic frame with this design. Shear stress as produced by the moving carriages, as well as z-wobble from the rods should theoretically be much less.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The acrylic might not wear by 'natural causes' since it is not a biologic material as wood is, but it will wear much faster due to handling the material, maintenance and human errors. The material is very brittle. You can find lots of reports on the web where the frame cracked or broke during setup. Here is my favorite example from someone with a lot of experience (1:20-2:30): &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkkVk8c8XoU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkkVk8c8XoU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Acrylic is a bad choice in terms of its mechanical properties: It is soft (I found low tensile strength as a number to compare in the given database), has lots of thermal expansion (5 times higher than stainless steel) and melts at 160 C (so beware of anything touching your hotend). Feel free to compare it to other materials here (no MDF or plywood in that database, though ;-) ): &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodfellow.com/E/Polymethylmethacrylate.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.goodfellow.com/E/Polymethylmethacrylate.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This altogether makes acrylic a very bad choice for a 3d printer frame material in my opinion. Choose MDF or plywood, you can make it look cool by painting it, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="168" LastActivityDate="2016-06-15T16:16:05.850" CommentCount="1" />

Alignment is also critical, otherwise you have a varying diameter from one color to the next at the point of join.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's an item on ebay which is precision drilled and has precision machined mating surfaces to ensure alignment of the filament. The filament is extended through the two components, heated (in the case of the video, with a match) and the two metal parts are pushed together. The joining of the metal parts also cuts away the excess bulge of the melted filament, ensuring correct diameter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of the above item, the joining devices have to be threaded with the filament prior to the joining process and then have to be threaded off the filament by pushing them the entire length of the filament.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would be okay if one were joining short lengths only.

However, notice that they have created their own software to meet a lot of these communication requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I forgot to mention the fact that a kink in creating a interchangeable machine is the control interface. The controller converts the &quot;software speak&quot; into an easily parsed series of functions (typically G-Code) for the small computer to process its predetermined hardware processes. Ie, The slicer or CAM software determines that a layer of a circle be 3D printed, milled, routered, or lasered, so the controller should &lt;strong&gt;G02I2&lt;/strong&gt; which could parse to &lt;sub&gt;(For all intents and purposes in javascript, not a practical language)&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;code&gt;CWCircularInterpolation(2,null,null,null,null,null)&lt;/code&gt; and run as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function CWCircularInterpolation(i,j,k,x,y,z){&#xA; //Some code to take current position and command to create a canned circle path&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point is that the software needs to handle the conditions and constraints of a different machining process and provide a well-equipped machine with the right commands.

But the equilibrium moisture content of most plastics in humid air can be more like 1%. As a consequence, &lt;strong&gt;hot air dehydration is standard practice&lt;/strong&gt; to prepare plastic pellets for extrusion in industry. Pretty much every injection-molded and extruded plastic product in the world -- including 3d printer filament -- is made with pre-dried pellets. Hot air is blown through the pellets until they are below the moisture limit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Different plastics tolerate extrusion with different amounts of moisture, and absorb different amounts of moisture. They can also tolerate different drying temperatures. So the ideal storage and drying conditions vary by material. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA&lt;/strong&gt; absorbs relatively little moisture, but in humid environments can accumulate enough water content to cause steam bubbles during extrusion. In some cases, steam bubbles can contribute to hot end jamming. Extreme wetness has been known to cause swelling that can increase filament feed drag. It's arguable whether wetness actually causes brittleness, or if that is a separate aging issue. People who keep their homes below ~50% relative humidity usually don't have any problems. Leaving PLA in a dry environment for a week or two should adequately re-dry it, or it can be gently heated to about 120F / 50C for a couple hours. (Some people dry it hotter. but that risks deforming the filament.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABS&lt;/strong&gt; also doesn't absorb very much water, but perhaps a little more than PLA. It also experiences steam bubbles, but that's typically the only issue. Homes below ~45% RH usually don't have problems. Storing ABS with fresh silica gel for a couple weeks will dry it. Or it can be oven-dried up to about 180F / 80C for an couple hours. &lt;strong&gt;HIPS&lt;/strong&gt; can be treated the same. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The kind of PET used in plastic bottles is rapidly degraded into tar by hydrolysis when melted with any significant water content. So &lt;strong&gt;PETG&lt;/strong&gt; filaments are specially blended to absorb less water and to be less damaged by water than PET. But there is still the possibility of bubbles and cloudy strands due to steam expansion at higher temperatures, and there is some evidence that wet PETG produces weaker, more brittle prints than dry PETG. Different manufacturers' blends require different conditions: some people report Taulman t-glase needs oven-drying and careful storage while Esun PETG is fairly tolerant of normal home humidity levels. Oven-drying at 150F / 65C should work well. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nylon&lt;/strong&gt; absorbs a huge amount of water, which causes it to swell considerably, produce massive steam bubbles, look cloudy, warp more, and adhere less than properly-dried nylon. It's nearly unprintable when wet. It should be oven-dried at around 150F / 65C for 4+ hours -- desiccant will not strip enough moisture from it. In fact, nylon will pull water out of used silica gel! Once dry, it should be stored with an aggressive desiccant (either bone-dry silica or preferably calcium chloride). It only takes a few hours of exposure to air for it to become excessively moist. Building a sealed drybox feed system is highly recommended to avoid exposed time during and between prints. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polycarbonate&lt;/strong&gt; is similar to nylon in that is is an aggressive water-absorber. It will look cloudy, produce steam bubbles, warp more, and provide very poor layer bonding when wet. It should be oven-dried at 180F / 80C if on a plastic spool (up to 250F / 120C if dried alone) for 4+ hours and then stored in a drybox with aggressive desiccant just like nylon. Note that some modern PC blends like Esun ePC are less prone to water absorption, at the cost of some decrease in mechanical properties. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PVA&lt;/strong&gt; is basically destroyed by airborne humidity, since it literally dissolves in water. Store in a drybox with an aggressive desiccant at all times. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Composite filaments should be treated like the base material. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some drying and prevention options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oven&lt;/strong&gt;: The &quot;warm&quot; setting will usually work pretty well. Let the oven preheat and settle out for a while, and measure temperature with a good oven thermometer or thermocouple. Shield the filament from direct radiant heating and hot spots with aluminum foil, cookie sheets, etc. Electric ovens will dry faster than gas ovens, because burning natural gas produces some additional moisture. Do not leave the oven unattended if using temperatures above the glass point of the filament, or bad things may happen!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Light bucket&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;: A 5-gallon plastic bucket with an incandescent lightbulb inside is a pretty effective way to gently warm low-temp filament like PLA for drying or medium-term storage. Leave the lid slightly open if drying. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food dehydrator&lt;/strong&gt;: Works great. Set temperatures as per the oven temps above. The main challenge is getting a large enough space inside for a filament spool. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desiccant&lt;/strong&gt;: In order for desiccant to actively dry filament, it must be significantly more attractive to water than the filament is. And affinity for water is a function of how wet the material already is. That means dry desiccant can easily pull some water out of very wet filament, but wet desiccant can actually give water TO the filament! Rechargeable indicator desiccant (such as an &lt;em&gt;Eva-Dry E-333&lt;/em&gt; unit) is ideal. It's also important to have ENOUGH desiccant: silica gel can only absorb 10% of its weight in water at 20% RH. That means to pull 1% moisture content out of a wet 1kg spool, you would need to start with at least 100g of bone-dry, fresh-baked silica! &quot;Used&quot; silica is basically useless, it already contains too much water to pull any more from the filament. But you can re-dry the silica in an oven. 250F / 120C for 6 hours should be safe for all types of silica gel, but more aggressive drying (including microwave drying) is possible for some silica gels. Follow the gel manufacturer instructions. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rice&lt;/strong&gt;: Does not work. It's basically a myth that rice has drying power. A bag of rice you buy at the store is already pretty close to moisture equilibrium with the air, so it has minimal capacity to pull water from filament (or a soaked iPhone, for that matter). If you dry the rice in an oven to drive out its water first, it will work to some degree, but silica gel is considerably more effective. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kitty litter&lt;/strong&gt;: Silica gel style kitty litter is nearly identical to desiccant silica gel. Like rice, it is fairly close to saturated when you open the container, but can be dried in the oven to be a good cheap bulk desiccant. Clay type kitty litter is not as effective. Be careful of getting kitty litter dust all over your filament. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry storage&lt;/strong&gt; A thick plastic box with an airtight seal is preferable. Look for recycling code 2 (HDPE) or 5 (PP) on the box. 5 gallon buckets with sealing lids also work fine. Ziplocks and other thin plastic bags are better than nothing, but are permeable to water (yes, really) and can only be relied on as long as there is fresh desiccant in the bag. Acrylic/plexiglas dryboxes have been sold by various people, but acrylic is very permeable to water, so I don't recommend that option. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air conditioning&lt;/strong&gt;: Simply keeping the air in your printing environment reasonably dry will protect PLA and ABS and other low-absorption filaments. It may help to buy a humidity monitor to get an understanding of your ambient humidity. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, considering the original question here, it's important to note that moisture content is not the only way filament can age or be damaged. PLA in particular is prone to becoming brittle over time. There are different theories for why this occurs. One is gradual chemical aging because poly(lactic acid) simply is not a very stable polymer. Moisture could contribute to that aging process, but true chemical aging would be irreversible even if the filament is later dried. How much this occurs should depend on the specific polymer blend and storage conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another theory for PLA aging is that the residual filament extrusion stresses (from being drawn down to the correct diameter and rapidly quenched in a water bath) are slowly creeping over time. Anyone who has placed a PLA part under heavy load for more than a few weeks will see PLA creep. It's a rather odd polymer in that it will &quot;creep to failure&quot; and crack at very low creep elongations rather than progressively deform in a ductile manner like most creep-prone materials. So if the PLA has significant stresses locked-in from the initial extrusion process (which is very common) it may be creeping into a more brittle arrangement of polymer molecules over time. That would explain the aging effect, and it would explain why &quot;drying&quot; sometimes rejuvenates the PLA: heating the filament near its glass point will allow the polymer molecules to gently relax and basically anneal to a less brittle state. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastEditorUserId="298" LastEditDate="2016-06-22T16:39:59.473" LastActivityDate="2016-06-22T16:39:59.473" CommentCount="2" />

Basically, the speed at which you feed filament determines how large of a volume comes out, and the distance you move the extruder means this volume gets distributed over this distance. However, this is not the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The size of your nozzle determines only two things: the &lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt; layer height and the &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; feature size. It does not affect minimum layer height (and obviously doesn't affect maximum feature size) although there are some practical constraints (you wouldn't want to print 0.1mm layers with a 5mm nozzle).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nozzle squishes the filament down as it is extruded; the filament is basically forced into the gap between the nozzle and the previous layer. There's no limit to how thin of a layer you can print (the 60 micron figure is just something the marketing department made up, you can likely print even thinner layers). So long as you can position your Z-axis with sufficient accuracy (which is usually no problem) you can print arbitrarily thin layers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the nozzle size does determine the maximum layer size. Your need the filament to be squished a bit, or else it won't stick to the previous layer properly. You can't print layers thicker than your nozzle size, and it is generally recommended to print with a layer size that is at most 80% of your nozzle size (e.g. with a 0.4mm nozzle you shouldn't attempt to print layers thicker than 0.32mm) but this is just a guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your extrusion width is the width of the line deposited by your nozzle. This is generally (due to the mentioned squishing) a bit larger than your nozzle size. With a 0.4mm nozzle you should set your extrusion width to something slightly larger, like 0.5mm. It is technically possible to print with an extrusion width that is the same as (or even smaller) than your nozzle size, but this results in very weak prints: as mentioned before, you want the plastic to get squished slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They claim an accuracy up to 100 micron. This doesn't mean that you can print features as small as 100 micron (since you can't, due to the extrusion width being much larger). What this means, is for example, that if you print a 10mm cube, you should expect its real size to be between 9.9mm and 10.1mm. Such a cube does not have any features that are smaller than your minimum feature size, but its outer walls can be positioned with greater precision than this minimum feature size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I should caution you that the 100 micron figure is &quot;up to&quot; and in practice you will have a hard time achieving this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastActivityDate="2016-06-23T07:10:39.380" CommentCount="1" />

A (previously?) common method to drop filament down to the hot end and create a heat-break between the heater and the extruder gear was the use of a PTFE (Teflon) sleeve. Over time, this sleeve can become clogged by filament that has melted and degraded/carbonized, sticking to the &quot;nonstick&quot; walls.

(Delta auto-calibration is one of the only big shortcomings of Repetier, in my opinion.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem with approaches like bed plane compensation and grid/mesh leveling for Deltas is that they don't fix print geometry errors caused by imprecise printer construction.

What I would recommend is to use one of the non-Repetier delta auto-calibration techniques available in order to get your firmware settings correct, and then you won't need to use &quot;slap a bandaid on a calibration problem&quot; solutions like grid leveling. Two popular options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Rich Cattell's Marlin branch&lt;/strong&gt;, perform auto-calibration, record the adjusted values, and then load those parameters into Repetier. This will usually work well enough that you don't need to attempt any kind of auto-leveling in Repetier. (I don't recommend actually printing with Marlin on a Delta due to lack of performance optimization. Repetier can print much, much faster while managing more features like LCDs. Marlin gets bogged down doing all the Delta kinematics math unless you print very slow.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use David Crocker's awesome &lt;a href=&quot;http://escher3d.com/pages/wizards/wizarddelta.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;online delta calibration tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; I'd recommend using six-factor calibration with 10 probe points.

Each layer therefore produces a little bit of force, pulling upwards and towards the center of the layer as the layer shrinks.  So each layer is actually in a state of slightly tensile stress.&#xA;Over a few layers this may not cause a noticeable effect, but as more layers are added, the total force pulling on the bottom layer increases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason this affects corners more than the bulk surface regions is that the total surface area holding the part to the bed is smaller at sharper corners, so less force is required there to overcome the bed-adhesion force, causing corners to unstick eventually.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since this is an artifact of thermal expansion, attempting to maintain a uniform temperature across the print volume/printed part will probably help a lot (for example, by enclosing the printer, as others have said).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the prior suggestions, the following paper suggests that chamfering (rounding) the corners can help with this (if your design allows for that):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1085&amp;amp;context=ijaaa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;D.

Sharp corners at the bottom of the print pose a particular problem.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side-thought:&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;I wonder if varying the bed temperature during the print (for example, slowly decreasing it to room-temp as more layers are printed) would help, since a constant bed-temp would theoretically produce a vertical temp-gradient for a very tall part.  Don't think I've seen anyone try that (presumably because Cura doesn't automatically insert those g-code commands for us).  Wouldn't be too hard to insert custom bed-temp commands throughout the g-code file though, but would take longer to temp-stabilize between layers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2383" LastEditorUserId="2383" LastEditDate="2016-07-03T19:25:06.083" LastActivityDate="2016-07-03T19:25:06.083" CommentCount="0" />

You'll probably want to heed some of the following points:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No colors in the background/stand, keep to shades (unless otherwise specified for scanner)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No gradients. This applies to poor lighting causing a &quot;gradient&quot; light effect&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Set the backdrop beyond the range of the scanner if possible (like with Skanect w/ Microsoft Kinect)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ideally set the backdrop and especially the stand in contrast with the color of the object.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're right, a typical 3D scanner will have a difficult time with darker colors due to physics. However, there are no rules that say you can't change the color of the object.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this application, &lt;strong&gt;I would suggest just going ahead and spray painting the object and scanning it&lt;/strong&gt;. Scanning the insole is going to require super tight tolerances in scanning as I'm assuming the insole is naturally worn due to use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Completely alternatively from 3D scanning, you could try using a 3D touch probe like on a CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine). It will take longer, but a touch probe doesn't care what color the object is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The touch probe comment seems to be a hit, so I'll elaborate. My experience with touch probes comes only from manufacturing technology and can be found and in a variety of different machine tools:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mills&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lathes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;CMMs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vision Systems&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Romer&quot; Arms (aka portable CMM)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could probably get away with searching for a local machine shop (or job shop) and asking if they have a machine for reverse engineering. The quickest and easiest machine for reverse engineering (in my experience) is a portable CMM, I recommend Googling it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, I've heard of people adding touch probes to their 3D Printers, but I haven't seen it before. In theory, a basic touch probe can easily be achieved by using a momentary switch. If you're good with programming and maybe a bit of Arduino, you could do the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add momentary (normally off) switch to Arduino &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Find a way of attaching the switch (below nozzles)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Connect to your 3d printer in your preferred method and preferred programming language. I've used the provided libraries in Python that come with installing MakerWare in order to connect to my MakerBot.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write your routine to sequentially move the new probe in a grid pattern and then incrementally move the Z up until you get a signal from your Arduino that the momentary has been switched on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For each trigger, append a simple text file with a new line containing the coordinates.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;once complete, you should have a &quot;point cloud&quot; of your insole which, if formatted correctly, will be able to import into CAD software&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few file types off the top of my head that can be used including:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;.pts&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;.XYZ&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;.CSV&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2016-07-05T13:09:06.560" LastActivityDate="2016-07-05T13:09:06.560" CommentCount="2" />

To simplify things we assume that all our pipes are closed into circuit and we have pump/battery and we have a motor which is a reverted pump ;) and finally we have our stepstick which is a tap in our model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So no matter what the height (voltage) is we know that tap (stepstick) will pass some amount (current) of water. We can drive it turning tap or turning a potentiometer on the stepstick PCB.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we got it.

Use your finger. If you can touch motor and hold your finger not more than half a second then probably the voltage set on potentiometer is too high (motor can reach 80° Celsius and it's fine but more will shorten its life span) and you should reduce it a bit (reduce by 5/100 V). If you notice that motor growls or barks then your voltage is probably too low and you can increase it by 5/100V.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Too high current will also reduce longevity of stepstick so cool them out with fan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please be noticed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Z-axis motors will usually be not too hot as they work less than X and Y but as they are both connected to one stepstick so they need more current - set higher voltage there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://reprap.org/wiki/Stepstick&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reprap.org site&lt;/a&gt; to get basic knowledge about stepsticks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1211" LastEditorUserId="854" LastEditDate="2016-08-01T22:45:16.660" LastActivityDate="2016-08-01T22:45:16.660" CommentCount="2" />

Most information you need is in there, I want to give some more practical advice, since that is what I understand you're question is asking for. I'll start with some points on the more theoretical side, though:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;notice that the Vref is not a voltage that is passed on to your motor. The described pipe analogy is very good, but the Vref is outside of this analogy. The reference voltage Vref is only used to set the current limit. This seems confusing, but has electronic reasons. One can understand the major (side-)benefit easily: Voltages are very easy to measure externally, because you connect your voltmeter in parallel. If you wouldd want to measure the current, you would need to get your ammeter in series with the circuit.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The stepsticks work by supplying the needed current for movement of the motor (current, because it works by creating magnetic fields), the voltage the stepstick supplies is 'just' supplied as high as needed to feed the desired current through your motor (determined by its resistivity/impedance). This just as an add-on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now to the practical side and the application of darthpixel's answer and the above:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You want to measure the reference voltage to limit the current that produces the torque, but also heats up the motor - let darthpixel's advice be your guide: if you can't touch it because it is too hot, then there is too much current, i.e. Vref is too high). To do so:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Set your multimeter to volts, range can be autorange or something bigger than 2V.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Connect one lead of your multimeter to the ground of your Prusa i3 controller board's power input (I use the screw that fastens the ground input of the RAMPS). The other lead goes directly to the center of the trimpot on the Stepstick. I took the best of my paint skills to create an image showing the process: &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/6cCzl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/6cCzl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;measure Vref scheme&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Note the value you read (12V power has to be on)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use an insulated screwdriver and turn the trimpot slightly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get a new reading by repeating the measurement process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Repeat the whole process until you get the desired Vref.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Warning: While I've had no problems turning the trimpot while everything was switched on (with my DRV8825 drivers), you should switch the power supply off when doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The described process allows only for a stepwise and rather slow setting of the Vref, but this is the easiest way I've found. I have read of people that use a crocodile clamp to attach the multimeter to the screwdriver for a readout while turning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't have any idea whether you need more or less current on the motor at the moment, check your resistors on the board and calculate the Vref you should need (see darthpixel's answer for the formula).

Which means when user add support then this option will be a result of it. Of course if user needs to have support only for the disk but over the disk there will be... a &quot;ceiling&quot; then option A cannot use regular support as it will generate a support also for the ceiling. For such situation user needs to add a cylinder manually (filled one) or&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;option B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;User can add hollow cyliner (just its walls). This option can give similar or higher stiffness as regular support because solid walls increase endurance tahn thin support grid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;option C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This option (my personal choose) has some advantages unavailable in A or B option. First - support doesn't have to have &quot;ground&quot; base. It means the yellow disk can really hang even if there is no bottom layer at all. Second - it joins walls with disk and walls together so the stiffness concerns other surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on needs the cylinder (option A or B) can be transformed into a cross or pillar (thinner than cylinder itself). It can be more taper expandint to the top or to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There could be even option where the above one would be joined with option C.

The following is a list of components which you might find in a typical hotend, but note that different designs may integrate these components to some extent. For instance, on the J-head the heat block, nozzle and heatbreak are all one and the same component whereas on the E3D hotends these are all separate parts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nozzle&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the part where the filament comes out. It takes in the molten filament (typically as a bead of 1.75mm/3mm) and tapers down to the nozzle size (typically around 0.4mm). These are typically made of brass for its good heat conductivity, but brass is not suitable for printing abrasive materials (such as glow in the dark and metal-filled filaments) so sometimes (hardened) stainless steel is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heater Block&lt;/strong&gt;: Usually made from aluminium, the heater block joins the nozzle to the heat break and holds the heater cartridge and thermistor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heater Cartridge&lt;/strong&gt;: most hotends use a ceramic heater cartridge, though some older designs use power resistors or nichrome wire. This component is, as the name suggests, responsible for heating up the hotend. The heat block usually clamps around the heater cartridge to provide good contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thermistor&lt;/strong&gt;: This part senses the temperature of the heat block. It is usually a small glass bead with two wires attached (which are typically insulated with glass fiber or teflon). For high-temperature printing, a thermocouple may be used in stead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat Break&lt;/strong&gt;: this is the part where hot meets cold. It usually takes the form of a thin tube and is made of stainless steel for its low thermal conductivity. The goal is generally to have the transition be as short as possible so as little of the filament is in a molten state as possible. It connects the heat block to the heat sink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat Sink&lt;/strong&gt;: the purpose of the heat sink is to cool down the cold side of the heat break. It is typically cooled with a fan. Most heat sinks also have a standard groove-mount for mounting to your printer. The heat sink usually has grooves to increase its surface area and cooling capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teflon Liner&lt;/strong&gt;: some hotends have a PTFE liner that guides the filament through the heat break into the nozzle. This makes it easier to print PLA, but compared to an all-metal hotend, limits the temperatures at which you can print (making it difficult to print PETG and impossible to print polycarbonate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ubis hotend you mentioned is a bit simpler than this, and simply uses a big chunk of PEEK in place of the heat break/sink. PEEK has very low thermal conductivity and thus passive cooling is sufficient. However, PEEK limits the temperatures at which you can print.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is an illustration outlining these components on an E3D V6 hotend:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/cjuNi.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/cjuNi.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that in this image the Teflon liner only goes into the heat sink, and not into the heat break or block.

Increasing &lt;strong&gt;Minimum Layer Duration&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(Device Settings -&gt; Minimum Layer Duration)&lt;/sub&gt; will provide the material with more time to naturally cool down closer to its environment's temperature. What this does is ensure that the latest layer is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; solid before the machine begins printing the next molten layer. If you don't let the previous layer of plastic solidify enough, then plastic gets pushed/pulled around when the machine moves, adding more plastic; thus resulting in the issue you see in your images. The caveat with this approach is the obvious impact on the overall runtime of your print and should ideally be done more or less as a last resort.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active Cooling&lt;/strong&gt;. Active cooling is typically done using an additional fan, often times mounted directly in front of the extruder. The act of active cooling provides a quicker and more direct means of cooling the printed plastic. However, depending on machine design, you may see more variability on other places such as dependability in extrusion temperatures. This can be more detrimental with cheaper spools of PLA and especially poorly designed machines that can't properly maintain extruder temperatures. Active cooling is, however, very common and seems to work for the majority of 3D printer enthusiasts and doesn't impede on runtime.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2016-07-20T22:21:44.703" LastActivityDate="2016-07-20T22:21:44.703" CommentCount="0" />

The paper discussed about using several techniques to print the tissue we need at functional resolution. The review also cites detailed procedures to 3D print lung and skin tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coming back to your question, we have reached a point in time where we can scan a real Iris and print them! Yes. And people use this technique called self assembly to achieve this (Other design approaches like Biomimicry and MiniTissue assembly is also being used right now). To do this we first extract cells from the donor. Or We do a functional high res scan of the extracted cell/part that we want to replicate. This is done via FMT-CT-Fluorescence Imaging, etc. And we cultivate the cells in bio incubators (we can also print cells btw - If the exact environment and operational conditions are maintained, we can print cell-replicas that will later self assemble to form the Iris with the same resolution and functional properties as that of the real one). The cultivated/printed cell is used as the tissue forming material. Forming is done by the cells themselves and is thus christened Self assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although this may sound futuristic, Autonomous Self Assembly is something that's already being done in Labs! The method works by studying embryonic organ development. For instance, Early stage cellular components of a developing tissue makes their own ECM. Like mentioned before, if we use proper signalling, and environmental manipulation,  we can create autonomous organization and patterning to make something we want. Advantage of this method is that we can work without scaffolds. This method relies on cell as primary driver of histogenesis. Knowledge of how an embryo grows into tissue (embroyo tissue genesis and organogenesis) is applied to achieve &quot;real&quot; cell dimensions/properties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would recommend you to read the paper for detailed information.

Hobbyists use it as a build plate -- Stratasys uses it as filament in their most expensive FDM machines. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Polycarbonate is a specialty material that benefits from a heated chamber but is just barely printable on hobbyist level machines. (I print a fair amount of PC -- it makes ABS seem easy in comparison.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By alloying PC with PEI, they are presumably optimizing some kind of performance parameter compared to ultem alone or polycarbonate alone. Exactly what material properties they get will depend considerably on the ratio of the two polymers. Ultem is exceptionally heat-resistant, quite stiff, and extremely strong. PC is very heat resistant, and has exceptional impact toughness. Blends of the two can be somewhat stiffer than either, with most other properties resembling the weighted average of the two base materials. It really depends on the mix, which we don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is analogous to the PC-ABS blend filaments we sometimes use. You get reasonably intermediate properties. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it's basically super-filament that NASA might want to use to make &quot;production&quot; parts in space.

This is reasoned by the shrinkage of the builplate while the print stays extended. The strain put into the interface helps to get the print of. Warming the plate could essentially do the same, but since you deposit a warm filament, one would assume that by warming up you will reduce the strain that has been built up by the regular cooling of the filament already.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess an uneven heating with a hairdryer will probably introduce uneven strain or evan some kind of warping of the buildplate that puts more strain to the interface which makes your approach work. If you want to test whether you have some local deformation you could characterize this by reflecting a laserpointer from the heatbed and marking the reflection on a rather far away wall for some controlled positions you can get the laser in (by say putting it on a photography tripod). The change of this reflections towards each other could tell you about the deformation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also agree that most of the hairdryers around would not be hot enough to be a worry, but since most of the Micro3D is made from plastic I would put twice the time into figuring out if that is really true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just for the fun of it, you could put an ice cube next to your finished print if you make sure that molten water will not go anywhere it is not supposed to be. Maybe this lifts off the print as well. However, I do not recommend doing this, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="168" LastActivityDate="2016-08-03T07:52:13.360" CommentCount="0" />

These are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_wiring&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;color coded&lt;/a&gt; depending on your country, usually earth is green (possibly with yellow stripes), neutral is blue, black, grey or white and live is brown, red or black.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The SSR should have 4 terminals: 2 terminals for the switched load (which are interchangeable) and 2 terminals that connect to your electronics, which should be marked negative and positive. These terminals should connect to the negative/positive heated bed output of your electronics. The terminals of the SSR should be clearly marked, and you can verify which terminal is what from the SSR's datasheet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Typically, your heated bed will have two wires for power (which are interchangeable). One of the wires should be connected to neutral. The other wire should go to one of the load terminals of the SSR, while the other load terminal of the SSR should connect to the live wire. It is also acceptable to do it the other way around (neutral to the SSR and live directly to the bed) but this is slightly less neat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, and this step is &lt;em&gt;extremely important&lt;/em&gt;, the earth wire of the plug has a protective function: should something fail, metal parts of your printer may become electrified, and shock you when you touch them. To prevent it, you should electrically connect exposed metal parts of your printer (such as the frame, heated bed plate, power supply case, etc...) to earth.

These are available in a variety of ratings, and will switch the power to your heated bed off when it goes over a certain temperature. This switch should be wired between the relay and the heated bed, and be mounted on the heated bed so it makes good thermal contact.

There is a reason that most people cannot break the .1mm barrier. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have several things happening. First if you are using a bowden. Good luck. The bowden treats plastic a lot like a spring. Just wont be able to generate a consistent pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The direct gear will have the same issue. You are trying to spit out 0.1mm on a 0.5mm nozzle. Factor in some simple drooling and your dot of plastic is missing. You wouldn't think it matters, but when we are using such tiny amounts of plastic, and consistently throughout the print, it makes for a really bad result!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you have more issues. This is why you jam. You now have a lot of plastic sitting, not being expelled. When you go from 0.2mm to 0.1mm you now take twice the time. Considering the printer was made to print at a 0.7 to 0.2 range (more or less). We are talking about a fair time for this plastic to sit molten, waiting to come out. Some have mentioned the heat crawl, but not exactly what happens or a solution. Now you do a retraction, and you just retracted molten plastic. Which gets jammed. Or your plastic cooks, carbonizes faster and clogs your hotend. Sad times! What you can do is ... turn off retraction, and then increase your flow / extrusion multiplier to account for the extra drooling. Part will have a lot of stringing, but a quick burst from a lighter fixes most of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can get better results with a hotend that has a fan and heat sink / break. I like the e3d hot ends. That will stop the heat crawl. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will note that Makergear once sent me an experimental 0.1mm nozzle. It could not build enough pressure to expel the plastic.

With my previous version of Marlin, 1.0.2-1, everything was working perfectly. I've transferred every parameter over from my older version to my newer one. There were some aspects of code that were written differently, but essentially everything works except the Z-Axis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The one issue that I seem to be having is with any kind of movement with the Z-Axis. When it moves, whether from the LCD or Repetier, it appears to accelerate as it is supposed to, but then gets stuck/skips a bunch of steps, and then decelerates slowly as it's supposed to. Regardless of the distance I instruct it to move, it will accelerate normally for the same amount of time/distance/steps, go into this unholy mode for a period of time/distance/steps relative to what it was instructed, and then smoothly decelerates for the exact same amount of time every time. For example, if it is supposed to move 10000 steps, it will move 100 steps smoothly, then skip for 9800 steps, and finish with another 100 steps smoothly. If, for example, it needs to move 5000 steps, it will also move 100 steps smoothly, then skip for 4800 steps, and finish smoothly the last 100 steps. Keep in mind, these numbers are completely drawn from space; they are not accurate by any stretch of the imagination. I'm just trying to paint as clear of a picture as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At first I checked to make sure everything is mechanically sound.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The nuts move freely up and down the 5mm threaded rod. There are no points along the entire length of the rod that the nuts don't move very freely.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The stainless steel rods are well aligned and the entire Z/X-Axis carriage moves very freely along the vertical rails. The bearings appear to be fine.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I then wanted to narrow it down to being the firmware, and not electrical. For the record, maybe I'm missing something obvious, so please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I measured the voltage on my A4988 stepper drivers on the RAMPS 1.4 board, sitting on the Arduino Mega2560 R3, and it is reading 350mV. Even if I adjust the potentiometer to 550mV, I still get the same issue.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The jumpers underneath seem to be snugly in place, and all the pins on the A4988 appear to be fine as well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The one thing I haven't checked in the section, logically analyzing, is the wires going from the board to the motors themselves, but based on the following, I don't believe that is the issue. (Although I have been wrong before)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moving onto the firmware. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've played around with the default settings section in Configuration.h with no avail.

Most materials are stickier when hot than cold. In comparison, pure mechanical-bonding bed surfaces like fibrous painter's tape and perfboard don't particularly benefit from bed heat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Warping is a bit more complicated. The basic cause of warping is when the previous layer is allowed to cool and thermally contract before the next layer is deposited. When you stick hot, expanded material on top of cold, contracted material, large shear stresses are generated when the fresh material cools and contracts. Those inter-layer shear stresses then accumulate over many layers into large-scale bending stresses that try to lift the edges of the print off the bed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to prevent warping, we should minimize the amount that the previous layer is allowed to cool before the next layer goes down. But we DO need it to cool solid so the print doesn't sag in a mushy mess. This is a balancing act: cooling the plastic solid without over-cooling it. The optimal temperature for the print is right around the glass point of the plastic: this is the temperature at which the plastic becomes fully solid and thermal contraction stresses start to accumulate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The extruder pumps more heat into the print as it deposits molten plastic and radiates a little bit of heat. So we want to set the heatbed temp a little bit below the glass point to ensure the print is able to cool solid. Now, this gets a bit difficult, because everyone's print bed temperature sensor is different. What matters is bed surface temp. Many people have to set their bed temp quite a bit higher than the actual surface temp. It's just something you have to calibrate via print results. The exact filament glass point (Tg) also depends on the blend. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ABS: Tg is around 105C, optimal bed temp 95C in a warm, low-airflow environment&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PLA: Tg is around 55C, optimal bed temp is 55C in a cool, high-airflow environment because PLA holds heat and is slow to cool compared to other filaments&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PETG: Tg is around 70C, optimal bed temp is 60-70C with mild airflow&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nylon doesn't really work with these rules because it's semi-crystalline, meaning it &quot;freezes&quot; far above its Tg and thus starts accumulating warping stress at fairly high temps... advice varies wildly, from printing cold to 120C bed&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PC: Tg is around 150C, optimal bed temp is 130C&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are other schools of thought, for example printing the first layer onto a surface much hotter than Tg for good adhesion, and then dropping the bed temp to a value somewhat below Tg to allow the print to solidify. That works fine too. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, with all that said, it's important to understand that the heatbed only keeps the bottom of the print warm. A centimeter up from the build plate, the print is typically much closer to ambient temp than it is to the bed temp. Heated build chambers are thus much more effective for large prints. But heatbeds are still quite effective, because they allow building a strong, warp-free foundation that resists warping stresses induced by the cooler zones higher up in the print. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-08-12T21:08:23.000" CommentCount="3" />

When the port is closed, this line is HIGH (indicating the computer is not ready), and when you open the serial connection the line goes LOW (indicating the computer is ready now) and the transition from HIGH to LOW triggers a reset.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways to prevent this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In software: disable hang up on close (HUPCL). This prevents the RTS line from going HIGH after you close it, allowing it to be subsequently opened without causing a reset. However, this does not work for the first attempt (the first, initial connection still causes a reset). How this is configured depends on your software/driver set up, but it is widely supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In software: disable the RTS line from going LOW in the first place.

RST is normally pulled high with a pull-up resistor (on the order of 10k or so), and when RTS transitions to low the capacitor briefly allows some current to flow, pulling RST low. One way to prevent this is to include a stronger pull-up resistor that overcomes the current drain associated with the RTS line going LOW. &lt;a href=&quot;http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/DisablingAutoResetOnSerialConnection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DisablingAutoResetOnSerialConnection&lt;/a&gt; suggests using a 330 Ohm resistor between VCC and GND.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hardware: desolder the capacitor mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastActivityDate="2016-08-20T22:07:06.097" CommentCount="3" />

Then, it repeats the process for the next layer. If you try to build, for example, a hollow ball, the ball gets created in the middle of the powder, meaning that there will be powder around the outside of the ball and in the &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; of the ball, and with the ball completely enclosed, there is no way for the powder that ends up inside the ball to get out.

You could also try using other solvents if acetone does not work for your particular plastic, but consider these tend to be quite toxic compared to acetone so be careful.

This extruder, basically, follows the OEM design with exception to the tubing diameter (few mils smaller for rebuilt, although there is a generous inlet taper and/or bushing, larger than the filament diameter feed stock) and the way the tubing has thermal contact with extruder body and cartridge heaters. The OEM design, apparently, had some thermal epoxy to &quot;bed&quot; the 2 nozzle tubes, which are brazed into the nozzle tip block. The approach, I am using, is Al foil packing around the SS tubes, tight to the Al extruder body (still brazed connection to the nozzle tip block). I had no choice but to recondition the extruder, because of a breached nozzle tube. In any case, with a cleared out nozzle inlet to start each time, I do get transient extrusion at standard temperatures of 250 (support) and 280 (model ABS), and in an adjusted temperature range, with some preliminary experiments. I clear out the nozzle inlet with a metal pin, down to the tube bend (I don't get why the design had this problematic 90 deg bend radius close to the cold end, feed wheel!) For the support, the extrusion goes for about 5 secs, then slows down, and the support filament feed stock stalls and strips out the filament, turning it into white debris.  For the model, the extrusion goes longer for about 20 secs, and also slows down, and, in this case, the model feed stock splits and gets fed outside the nozzle tube inlet, but no white debris in this case. This cycle may be repeated by cleaning out the inlet clogging with the stiff metal pin. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize this is not a perfect description of the system, but I am hoping that someone who knows this extruder configuration or a similar one (system is quite old, unfortunately), may chime in here with suggestions.
