# BugQuery
BugQuery is a search engine for stack traces. It helps programmers solve bugs in their code in a quick and efficient way, using an index of questions and answers extracted from dedicated web services (like StackOverflow). BugQuery includes, along with this index, a website and a plug-in for Eclipse.
