# BugQuery
BugQuery is a search engine for stack traces. It helps programmers solve bugs in their code in a quick and efficient way, using an index of questions and answers extracted from dedicated web services (like StackOverflow). BugQuery includes, along with the Q/A index, a website and a plug-in for Eclipse.

## Use BugQuery to Debug Your Code
Debugging is a lot of hard work - exporting your output, searching multiple websites for something similar... The time adds up quickly! What if there was a simpler way? Well, now there is: BugQuery. BugQuery automatically collects the details that matter about your output, and gives you beautifully formatted answers within seconds. [BugQuery Essentials](https://github.com/TechnionYP5777/Bugquery/wiki/User-Guide) has all the information you'll need to get started.
